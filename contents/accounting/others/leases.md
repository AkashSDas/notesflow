## Introduction

---

Lease contracts is a form of long-term financing for assets and sometimes, the lease contracts look just like the accounting for loans, but sometimes they don't show up at all.

A lease is a rental agreement. One party (the lessor) transfers to another party (the lessee) the right to use an asset for a stated period of time in return for a stated series of payments. Commonly leased assets are airplanes, buildings, equipment, vechicles.

> **Leases can be of any duration**
>
> - Short-term leases: Allow use of an asset that would be inefficien to purchase. Eg. Use of a rental carf for one week under a contract that can be cancelled at any time.
> - Long-term leases: Similar to a financing arrangement to purchase a long-lived asset. Eg. Use of a rental car for 5 years under a noncancellable contract.

## Captial Lease vs Operating Lease

> Accounting rules require that certain long-term leases be treated as if the company bought the asset with debt financing (those will be capital leases).
> **Capital Lease**
>
> - Record lease asset and lease liability on the balance sheet
> - Record Depreciation Expense and Interest Expense on the Income Statement

> But other long-term leases can be still treated as rentals
> **Operating Lease**
>
> - `Off-Balance Sheet` activity: No asset or liability on the balance sheet
> - Record Rent Expense on Income Statement

**Why would a lease ever be treated like you bought the asset? You did not buy the asset!** It does seem weird that we're leasing an asset or renting an asset, but we're going to treat it as if we bought it in some cases. But what we're trying to do is get to the economic substance of the transaction. If we are going to lease the asset for almost all of its life or pay almost all of its current value, then it's as if we bought the asset even though contractually we haven't. So we just viewed it as providing users of financial statements better information to treat some of these leases as if we bought the asset.

To determin whether a company should use Capital or Operating Lease there will 4 criteria:

> **Firms must use capital lease accounting if one of the following applies:**
>
> - Ownership is transferred at the end of lease
> - The `bargain purchase` options exists (right to buy asset at lease end for less than market value)
> - Lease period covers more than 75% of assets life
> - Present value of contractual future lease payments is at least 90% of the current market value of the asset (So what that means is if you use the time value of money stuff and you figure out the value of those future lease payments in today's dollars. If that's 90% or more of what you could buy it for today, then it's almost like you're paying as much as buying it and it would trip this criteria, and you'd have to use capital leave treatment. So again, any one of these being tripped would cause capital lease treatment. If they're all no, then you can use operating lease.)

**Tax rules are different and irrelevant for the choice of capital vs operating lease accounting for financial reporting.**

A lot of companies strive to get capital lease treatment for taxes and operating lease treatment for the financial statements on the same lease contract. Capital lease treatment for taxes is preferred because you recognize interest expense and depreciation expense, both of which reduce your taxable income, and save you on taxes early on in the lease life. Operating lease treatment is often preferred for the books because it keeps the asset and liability off the balance sheet, making a lot of your ratios look better. So your ROA looks better, your debt to equity looks better, so, yeah, a lot of companies try to use these different criteria to do capital lease method for taxes and operating lease method for the financial statements.

If in operating lease you don't have any entry i.e. you must have to record a liability for the lease payments. This is weird because you signed a non-cancellable contract to make these lease payments in the future. Sounds like a liability, but the idea here is that since you don't satisfy those criteria, you're not using up a lot of the asset's life.l So at any point you could give the asset back to the lessor to get out of the contract and then not have to make those future payments. So the default case is, there's enough uncertainty here that we're not going to view those payments as a liability.

> - The expenses are a little bit lower under the operating method early on and a little bit higher later on. So if you wanted smaller expenses earlier on in the least term operating would make sense, but the big difference here the big impact between capital and operating lease is on the balance sheet and the fact that capital has these assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.

> **Capital leases always have higher Cash from Operations**
>
> - Operating leases
>   - Rent expense is an Operating Cash Flow
> - Capital Leases
>   - Interest Expense is an Operating Cash Flow
>   - Reduction in the lease liabilities in a Financing Cash Flow
>   - Depreciation Expense is non-cash expense

Even though the cash payments are the same, the computer is the same, and the lease contract is the same, you have different effects on the Statement of Cash Flow. Although notice no one method dominates the other because capitol lease actually gives you better cash flow even though it might be hurting your earnings early on, and hurting your ratios.

**Do companies play with their estimates so that they can justify using the method that makes their financial statements look the best?** yeah, that probably goes on, as do many other people in the financial markets. And as a result, there's a movement to change the rules to try to get rid of any game-playing incentives that might exist.

## Lease Accounting Controversy

---

> - This accounting for leases is controversial because operating lease accounting allows firms to keep substantial financial obligations of their balance sheet, potentially distorting the firm's leverage.
> - The FABS and IASB are both currently considering proposals to eliminate operating lease accounting.

## Converting Operating Lease to Capital Lease

---

So the big problem is, is on the balance sheet, you could also adjust the income statement and cashless statement but that tends not to be as big of a deal.

To adjust for this operating lease effect when calculating ratios is to try to capitalize them.

> **Adjust Balance Sheet**
>
> - Calculate the PV of minimum future operating lease payments disclosed in footnotes.
> - Capitalize these leases by adding the PV to Long Term Assets and to Long Term Debts OR a quick shortcut is multiply Rent Expense by 8 to estimate the asset and liability. (obviously that's a very crude method because it doesn't ad, allow for differences in interest rates. But it actually performs pretty well in most circumstances so, it would be a quick way to try to estimate that.)

Something like an 8 times rent expense, which assumes a constant payment, may actually give you a better guesstimate of the amount than the present value approach. Although we can look at both and split the difference.
