### Tax Reporting vs Financial Reporting

---

> - Income tax expense on the income statement is based on per-tax income computed using GAAP or IFRS

```text
Financial Statements ('Books'):

    Pre-tax income (per GAAP/IFRS rules)
x   Effective tax rate
----------------------------------------
=   Income tax expense
```

> - Income tax payable (or paid in cash) is based on Taxable Income using tax code rules

```text
Tax Return:

    Taxable Income (per IRS/Your country's rules):
x   Statutory tax rate
----------------------------------------------------
=   Income Tax Payable
```

**The two tax amount can be different!!!** These can be different either of **Permanent Differences** or **Temporary Differences**.

| Examples                                        | GAAP/IFRS                                     | Tax Code                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Interest income from muncipal bonds             | Interest revenue increases per-tax income     | Does not affect income (tax-exempt)             |
| Cash advances from customers (unearned revenue) | Revenue recognized when earned (in future)    | Revenue recognized when cash collected (now)    |
| Bad debt expense                                | Revenue is recognized when sale is made (now) | Expense when account is written-off (in future) |
| Depreciation                                    | Depreciation method choosen by firm           | Depreciation schedule from tax authority        |

We need two sets of rules because there's two different objectives for these two sets of books. Tax accounting and tax rules is all about raising tax revenue for the government. It tries to do it in a fair and equitable manner. Plus it tries to provide incentives for companies to do certain kind of behavior as we'll talk about a little bit later. Financial accounting the goal that's provide useful information to external stakeholders like investors, creditors, customers, suppliers, employees, and it just turns out that those two goals are not. Easily reconcilable. So we have two sets of rules and we just have to live with those two sets of rules.

### Permanent Difference

---

> **Permanent Difference**
>
> - Revenues that are never included in taxable income and expenses that are never deductible for tax purpose i.e. it shows up in the book but never shows up in tax returns. Examples are interest on tax-exempt muncipal bonds, tax penalties and tax credits, state and foreign taxes.
> - Do not reverse over time
> - Cause the Effective Tax Rate to not equal the Statutory Tax Rate-

By do not reverse over time what it mean is that this interest revenue that's on the books will never, ever, ever appear on the tax return. Under temporary differences you'd have a situation where revenue would be on the books now and then the same revenue would show up on the tax return later. Whereas a permanent difference you never see that kind of reversal over time.

There really is only one tax rate there's the statutory tax rate. This effective tax rate is something that we calculate from financial statement numbers. It's, it's almost like a ratio, and what it does it measures how much the firm's taxes are susceptible to these permanent differences. How much they increased. Or decrease their tax rate away from the statutory rate.

### Temporary Difference

---

> **Temporary Difference**
>
> - Revenues or expenses recognized in a different period for tax purpose than for financial reporting. Eg. book vs tax depreciation, bad debt expense, unearned revenue
> - Reverse over time
> - Stored up in Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

### Pre-Tax Income vs Taxable Income

---

> - **Pre-Tax Income: Earnings before taxes under GAAP/IFRS**
> - **Taxable Income: Earnings before taxes under tax rules**
> - Differences between pre-tax income and taxable income arise from permanent and temporary difference

### Income Tax Payable

---

> - **Statutory Rate** - Tax rate set by the Goverment
> - Income Tax Payable: Taxes owed to the Goverment = Taxable Income x Statutory Rate

**Why is this income tax payable and not income tax paid? Where do we show the cash taxes that we pay the government?** Income tax payable i used here instead of cash as the credit, because usually when you're doing these kind of tax calculations for your books. You haven't filled out the tax return yet, and so you don't owe the cash today. Instead, you do an income tax payable. Then later on when you do your tax return, then you would debit income tax payable and credit cash to pay off that liability, but the important thing is to view income tax payable as the amount of cash that you will eventually pay to the government in taxes. So this is what we owe the government in our taxes.

### Adjusted Pre-Tax Income

---

> - Used to compute income tax expense for financial reporting
> - Pre-tax income adjusted for permanent tax differences

Once we get to adjusted pre-tax income, once we take out the permanent differences, then the only differences between adjusted pre-tax income and taxable income. Will be the temporary differences.

### Income Tax Expense

---

> - Number reported on the income statement
> - Adjusted per-tax income times Statutory Rate
> - Differs from Income Tax Payable due to Temporary Differences

### Income Tax Expense vs Income Tax Payable

---

> - Temporary Differences reverse over time

**Why not just make Income Tax Expense equal to the Income Tax Payable?** . It would be much easier to have income tax expense just equal the taxes that we pay the government, income tax payable, but it would also be much easier if we just had revenue equal to cash collected from customers. You know and it would also be much easier if we just had cost it has sold equal to cash paid for inventory. So you get the point. We do revenues and expenses that are different than the cash paid because of this notion of accrual accounting. Trying to reflect this notion of business activities, did we charge enough for our product or services to cover all the cost of doing business, based on business activities. Income tax expense is the same idea. It's the cost of income tax that we've incurred this period by all the activities we've done this period, and we want to recognize that as an expense, even if it's not all paid in cash this period, even if some of that will be paid in cash in the future. So it's the exact same idea of acruel accounting that we've been using for all of the other expenses so far.

### Effective Rates

---

> - **Effective Tax Rate = Income Tax Expense / Pre-Tax Income**
> - Does not equal 35% (Statutory Rate) because of Permanent Differences
> - Does not reverse

Permanent differences caused this Effective Tax Rate, the Income Tax Expense divided by Pre-tax Income. Caused that Effective Tax Rate to not equal that Statutory Rate of 35%.

We mean effective in the sense of in effect at the time. So the effective tax rate is the tax rate that was in effect. During the year which we define as the income tax expense divided by the pre-tax income.

**If we need to do tax calculations like compute after-tax interest for ROA, should we use the effective tax rate or statutory tax rate?** No, don't use the effective rate for tax calculations. This is a thing that a lot of people do, and I, and I totally think it's wrong. Because this effective rate reflects the impact of this municipal bond interest revenue. If you were then going to apply that to some other kind of transaction. It's not the right rate to use. You always want to use the statutory rate in tax calculations, Alway, always, always. Always use the statutory rate in tax calculations. Don't use the effective rate because the effective rate is messed up by these permanent differences which don't necessarily apply to other things that you're looking at.

### Revision of Temporary Difference

---

> - Difference between Income Tax Expense on the Income Statement and Income Tax Payable to the goverment that will reverse over time
> - **Income Tax Expense = Adjustment Pre-Tax Income x Statutory Tax Rate**. Adjusted Pre-Tax Income are based on GAAP/IFRS rules and excludes permanent differences.
> - **For convenience, the word Pre-Tax Income is used instead of Adjusted Pre-Tax Income**
> - Income Tax Payable = Taxable Income x Statutory Rate
>   - Taxable income based on tax code rules
>   - Paid to the goverment
> - Temporary Differences are stored in Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
> - Here 35% is used as a Statutory Tax Rate in all calculations unless otherwise noted

Do not use the effective tax rate to do these calculations. The effective tax rate reflects the impact of permanent differences. When we're talking about temporary differences, we don't want to use a tax rate that's biased by things that have nothing to do with what we're talking about. Always, always, always use the statutory rate for these calculations.

### Introduction to Deferred Tax Liabilities

---

It aries from temporary differences where, initially, tax rules require bigger expenses or smaller revenues than GAAP/IFRS. Now what we mean by initially is at the start of whatever transaction generates the temporary difference. So for instance, if you buy a new piece of equipment, you´re going to depreciate that different for book and tax, and so initially we´re talking about the first years of depreciation. Now in those first years, there are bigger expenses on the tax return. Bigger expenses mean that taxable income is less than pre-tax income. Or flipping it around pre-tax income is greater than taxable income. That means that income tax expense has to be greater than income taxes payable. Both income numbers are multiplied by 35%, so that means that more pre-tax income means more income tax expense.

> - Pre-tax income > Taxable income
> - Income tax expense > Income tax payable

We're going to create a deferred tax liability which is going to represent the obligation to make higher tax payments in the future.

The deferred tax liabilities represents the obligation to make higher tax payments in the future.

Dr. Income Tax Expense (+E)         100
  Cr. Deferred Tax Liability (+L)     10
  Cr. Income Tax Payable (+L)         90
```

Let's just say it's 100, I'm making these numbers, so we debit income tax expense for 100. Income tax expense is greater than income taxes payable, so we credit income taxes payable the liability which shows that we owe the government for, let's say, 90. We're going to credit a deferred tax liability, create a deferred tax liability for the difference, 10, which is going to represent that obligation to pay that extra 10 in taxes in the future. So we saved 10 in taxes, now we're going to pay 10 extra in taxes in the future.

> **In future GAAP will require bigger expenses or smaller revenues than tax rules**
>
> - Pre-tax income < Taxable income
> - Income tax expense < Income tax payable

```text
Future
---------------------------------------------
Dr. Income Tax Expense (+E)         90
Dr. Deferred Tax Liability (-L)     10
  Cr. Income Tax Payable (+L)         100
```

So, in the future GAAP is going to require bigger expenses or smaller revenues than tax rules, so it's a temporary difference, it reverses. Pre-tax income will now be less than taxable income. Income tax expense will be less than income taxes payable. Less pre-tax income means less income tax expense on the financial statements. And we'll see the journal entry reverse. So we've got debit income tax expense for say 90, credit income tax payable for 100. Now the expense is less than the payable and so we're going to debit deferred tax liability for 10 which reverses out this temporary difference. And basically represents the fact that we've now paid this higher tax obligation that we knew we were going to have in the future.

So when you see a deferred tax liability, view it as an obligation to make future payments of extra taxes and those extra taxes are as a result of the fact that you saved some taxes to date. So by saving taxes now it's created an obligation to pay extra taxes for the future and that's pretty much the definition of a liability.
100
Well, it matters whether we save taxes today or in the future because of the time value of money, which we just said we ignore for deferred tax liabilities but which we don't ignore in the real world. You would always rather save a dollar of taxes today than save it in the future because as we talked about a dollar today is going to be worth more than a dollar in the future. Another way you could think about it is you save taxes today, you can use that money to invest in some kind of investment, and basically get a return on that investment, which not only covers the amount taxes that you have to pay in the future, but gives you a little bit extra. So, the reason why the US government has accelerated depreciation for equipment is basically to encourage investment. By giving this tax break on the first years of depreciation, it encourages companies to go out and buy new equipment, to invest in the economy, and then they can get the benefit of these tax savings, which are worth more today than tax savings would be worth more in the future because of the time value of money.

### MACRS schedule

---

MACRS is the name of the depreciation schedules that we have in the US. It stands for Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System. There are still tax depreciation schedules in every country. So every country has some kind of depreciation schedule. And oftentimes it's accelerated to provide these kinds of tax savings for companies.

> - **Accountants basically have four or five tricks and we keep applying those tricks over and over and over again. One of them is contra assets.**
> - we have to debit an expense based on accrual accounting practices. We credit cash based on how much cash we owe. The two numbers don't equal, and so then we use a liability to basically plug the difference, to store up the difference between the expense and the cash. This trick is used again and again.

It just turns out that under US GAAP and under IFRS used in many countries around the world including Hong Kong, the rules state that we don't use present value for deferred tax liabilities, or deferred tax assets which we'll see later. The deferred tax liabilities just reflect the nominal dollars, the actual dollars we owe. We don't discount them to present value. Now we will have to take into account changes in tax rates that might happen in the future, so we're going to see that later on. But just by rule, we don't take into account present value when doing these, and that's just the way that it is.

> **Temporary Difference**
>
> - Timing of depreciation expense and tax expense is shifted across time
> - But totals are the same between books and taxes

So, the difference between tax reporting and financial reporting with temporary differences, doesn't mean that you pay more or less tax, or have more or less expense. All it's doing is shifting those expenses, and those taxes across time.

**Why does it matter whether the taxes are paid sooner or later?** Well, it matters whether we save taxes today or in the future because of the time value of money, which we just said we ignore for deferred tax liabilities but which we don't ignore in the real world. You would always rather save a dollar of taxes today than save it in the future because as we talked about a dollar today is going to be worth more than a dollar in the future. Another way you could think about it is you save taxes today, you can use that money to invest in some kind of investment, and basically get a return on that investment, which not only covers the amount taxes that you have to pay in the future, but gives you a little bit extra. So, the reason why the US government has accelerated depreciation for equipment is basically to encourage investment. By giving this tax break on the first years of depreciation, it encourages companies to go out and buy new equipment, to invest in the economy, and then they can get the benefit of these tax savings, which are worth more today than tax savings would be worth more in the future because of the time value of money.

## Deferred Tax Assets

---

> - **Aries from temporary difference where, initially, tax rules require smaller expenses or bigger revenues than GAAP/IFRS**

So again, at the beginning of the transaction that creates the temporary difference, you initially have smaller expenses or bigger revenues on the tax return. Which means that pre-tax income is going to be less than taxable income, where you have the smaller expenses or bigger revenue, and if we have less pre-tax income, we must have less income tax expense. because again, both income numbers get multiplied by 35%, so income tax expense is less than income taxes payable.

> - Pre-tax income < Taxable income
> - Income tax expense < Income tax payable

We're going to create a def, deferred tax asset, which is going to represent the benefit of tax savings that we're going to get in the future.

```text
Today
---------------------------------------------
Dr. Income Tax Expense (+E)         90
Dr. Deferred Tax Asset (+A)     10
  Cr. Income Tax Payable (+L)         100
```

So, the way the journal entry would look is, we debit income tax expense and, again, just making up numbers. Let's make up 90 for income tax expense. We know that's less than income taxes payable. So we credit income taxes payable for 100, again making up numbers. To get this to balance, we create a deferred tax asset, of 10, that represents the fact that _we paid more taxes to the government today, but those extra payments are going to get us tax savings in the future_. The deferred tax asset is the benefit of those tax savings.

In the future, GAAP/IFRS will require smaller expenses or bigger revenues than tax rules.

```text
Future
---------------------------------------------
Dr. Income Tax Expense (+E)         100
  Cr. Deferred Tax Asset (-A)         10
  Cr. Income Tax Payable (+L)         90
```

This deferred tax asset mechanics is going to be just like the mechanics that we've seen for deferred tax liabilities, except the initial condition is reversed.

Don't think deferred tax asset as reflecting good news or reflecting bad news. Just think of it as, it is was it is. It reflects future tax savings that you're entitled to because you had to pay extra taxes this period because of the differences between the tax rules and accounting rules. So, the deferred tax asset represents these future tax savings, which makes it an asset.

**Are there any other tax differences that require the use of deferred tax assets?** Yes, there are other transactions that give rise to deferred tax assets, and in fact, deferred tax assets are probably more common than deferred tax liabilities. So, it's not all about getting those tax savings that are in depreciation. So, some items that also generate these kind of deferred tax assets include punching benefits and other employee, other employee benefits warranties, inventory methods between FIFO and weighted average could cause this. Acquisitions of am, of intangible assets and the difference in amortization schedules could cause deferred tax assets. And, these animals called non-operating loss carry forwards.

> **Temporary Difference**

> - Timing of bad debt expense and tax expense is shifted across time
> - But totals are the same between books and taxes

## Changes in Future Tax Rates

---

Deferred tax assets and liabilities must be based on excepted future tax rates. Generally, assume that current tax rate will continue into the future.

If the goverment change the Statutory Tax Rate, the balances in DTAs and DTLs must be adjusted to reflect the new rate, with the adjustment running through Income Tax Expense.

> **Tax Rate Increases**
>
> - DTAs increase -> Dr. Deferred Tax Asset (+A), Cr. Income Tax Expense (-E)
> - DTLs increase -> Dr. Income Tax Expense (+E), Cr. Deferred Tax Liability (+L)

> **Tax Rate Decreases**
>
> - DTAs decrease -> Dr. Income Tax Expense (+E), Cr. Deferred Tax Asset (-A)
> - DTLs decrease -> Dr. Deferred Tax Liability (-L), Cr. Income Tax Expense (-E)

**Does this mean that some companies would be better off with a tax rate increase, and some would be better off with a tax rate decrease?** All companies would want to see tax rates come down because they would pay less in taxes, overall. But in terms of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, there will be different winners or losers depending on the tax rate change for these extra tax savings or extra tax payments that companies have to make. So if the tax rate goes up, then it's good news if you have deferred tax assets, because your tax savings in the future will be saving you taxes at a higher tax rate. You're unhappy if you have deferred tax liabilities, because you'll be paying back those extra taxes at a higher rate. If you had a tax rate decrease, then it's the opposite. You're not as well off with deferred tax assets. Your tax savings will come at a lower rate in the future, whereas you're better off with deferred tax liabilities because your future tax payments will come at a lower tax rate.

**Why would the company have to record an expense today when the higher taxes will be paid in the future?** This kind of entry should be a debit to accumulated other comprehensive no, I mean, accumulated other comprehensive income. It is distorting the tax expense when this happens. And so, what companies will do is any time there's a tax rate change and they have these weird entries, they'll often disclose that there was an unusual tax expense due to the change in the rates, reflecting the re-valuation of their deferred taxes. it's, the good news is the corporate tax rate doesn't change that often, so you don't have to deal with these entries that often.

**Can you really have a negative expense?** Yes, you can have a negative expense. It's, it's essentially reducing what your income tax expense is, and it's not the last time you're going to see this kind of negative expense with tax accounting.

## Valuation Allowance and NOLs

---

So sometimes, we have to create a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets represent future tax savings, a reduction in future cash outflows.

But companies can only realize those tax savings, those reduction in future cash outflows, if they're profitable. The deferred tax asset would then reduce taxes paid if you're profitable, but it won't produce a refund if the company does not have to pay taxes. When does a company not have to pay taxes? Companies don't have to pay taxes when they have negative taxable income. So, to use a deferred tax asset, a company must have positive taxable income and positive income tax payable in the future. Because then it can use the deferred tax asset to reduce that income tax payable and get the benefit of the tax savings.

> - Companies can only report a Deferred Tax Asset if its `more likely than not` the firm will be profitable enough in the future to take advantage of the tax savings.
> - If it is not `more likely than not`, companies must reduce the DTA using a Valuation Allowance (XA). IT just works like Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

**Not more likely than not? Here is a suggestion. Why not say greater than 50% or less than 50%? We can do without the double not sentences.**

### Net Operating Losses (NOLs)

> - A net operating loss occurs in a year when taxable income is negative
> - Federal tax law permits taxpayers to use NOLs to offset the profits of prior and future years. ( Now, most countries in the world have similar laws with NOLs. The only thing that might differ is the number of periods)
> - First, carry the NOL back 2 years and receive refunds for income taxes that have already been paid in those years.
> - Any loss remaining after 2 years carryback can be carried forward up to 20 years to offset future taxable income
> - Create a deferred tax asset for the amount of tax saving due to NOL Carryforwards

don't think of it as carrying around a loss for the next 20 years. Think about it as carrying around a get-out-of-taxes-free card, which allows you to get out of paying some taxes anytime in the next 20 years.

There's restrictions on moving losses across jurisdictions. So if you have a loss in Lichtenstein, you can't use that loss to offset income in Sweden. But there are creative things that you can do to try to shift income from Sweden into Lichtenstein or, or at least I've heard

**So, a valuation allowance is a permanent write off of the deferred tax asset. It has been used up as an expense now, correct?** No. It is not a permanent write down. If circumstances change and you think that you might be able to use those NOL carryforwards in Liechtenstein in the future, you can undo this entry. Reverse it, basically get rid of the expense, get rid of the valuation allowance, and restore the full value of the deferred tax asset to the balance sheet.

**All the company has to do is say that it is now optimistic about the future, and it can create a negative expense, or, I should say, a gain?** This is a journal entry that you want to keep an eye out for because there is a lot of potential for abuse. If a company was just short of an earnings target, all it would have to do is say that circumstances have changed in one of its subsidiaries, where now they think they will be able to use these deferred tax assets. So they do this journal entry to reverse out the valuation allowance, create a negative expense and an increase of net income. So, if you ever do see one of these journal entries, you want to be a little skeptical and you want to see if you can find any other information to indicate that it's legitimate. Otherwise, it could just be last chance earnings management.

There actually is some academic research that finds managers use these reversals of valuation allowance as a way to manage earnings. So where can I find out all this cool information about valu, valuation allowances? Well, in the footnote disclosures

## Deferred Tax Footnotes

> - Components of Income before Tax
>   - Domestic vs Foreign
> - Components of Income Tax Expense
>   - Currently Payable vs Deferred
> - Reconciliation from Statutory to Effective Income Tax Rates
>   - Permanent differences
> - Components of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
>   - Temporary differences and Valuation Allowance
> - Differences between Footnote and Balance Sheet
>   - Deferred tax assets and liabilities may be netted by jurisdiction on the balance sheet. Which means that the totals you see in the footnote won't be the totals that you see on the balance sheet, because the balance sheet reflects some of this jurisdictional netting.
>   - Deferred tax assets and liabilities may be split into current and noncurrent portions on the balance sheet, whereas when we get into the footnote, we see that we don't make that distinction.

**What do you mean by jurisdiction? And what about netting?** The term, jurisdiction, means any government that can tax you. So, a country. A state or a province, a city, anybody that can tax you is a separate jurisdiction. Netting, means that you net the deferred-tax assets and deferred-tax liabilities in a jurisdiction to get one number. So, let's say in Canada, you had more deferred-tax assets than deferred-tax liabilities, you'd have a net deferred-tax asset in Canada. But in Sweden, you had more deferred tax liabilities than for taxed assets. You'd have a net deferred tax liability in Sweden, so on the balance sheet you could see both a deferred taxed assets and a deferred taxed liability, and it represents that you have different deferred taxes in different jurisdictions.

**Why do we care if something is higher or lower on the tax return than on the books? What does it have to do with the price of fish anyway?** If there's a big difference between your books and your tax return, it could indicate something fishy is going on. There's a number of reasons why the books and tax could be very different for these. It could be different growth rates, levels of activity, can tell you how much cash we're spending or getting because that's what you often see on a tax return. Or it could indicate a problem with manipulation where you're manipulating something on your income statement but not on your tax return, or maybe vice versa. So the first step is just to see how big these differences are. And then the second step would be to try to understand what's driving those differences.

**Is the Deferred Taxes line a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability?** You know, this credit to deferred taxes is vague because we don't know whether it's deferred tax assets or liabilities. But there's some additional information that we can get which will tell us. How much of this is DTAs, and how much of this is DTLs

> - **The numbers in brackets are not negative numbers. They're all positive numbers they're just in brackets to represent that they're credits**

> - For financial statement purposes, **warranties** are expensed when you sell goods, when you sell goods to the customers. But for tax purposes, there's no tax deduction until you actually pay the cash to fix the product down the road. So it works just like bad debt expense, where the financial statements get the expense first. And a tax deduction comes later.

## How taxes work on Statement of Cash Flow and Marketable Securities

---

### Statement of Cash Flow

---

> - All operating activity line items on the SCF are shown pre-tax
> - All the tax effects are reflected in:
>   - Changes in Deferred Taxes
>   - Changes in Income Tax Payable

You could add Net Income plus Depreciation because the former was after-tax, and the latter is pre-tax. This is the rare example of an over simplification that's actually correct because we adjust for tax effects else where, it's okay to start with after-tax net income, and add back pre-taxed depreciation expense.

> **Example**
>
> Statutory Tax Rate = 35%
>
> Company increase book Depreciation Expense by $100 in 2011
>
> - Pre-tax income goes down by $100
>   - Income tax expense goes down by $36 (100 x .35)
>   - Net income down by $65 (100 - 35)
> - Tax Depreciation is unaffected
>   - Taxable income unaffected, Income Tax Payable unaffected
> - Balance these differences with a reduction in Deferred Tax Liability of $35
>
> ```text

>   Cr. Accumulated Depreciation (+XA)      100
> Dr. Deferred Tax Liability (-L)         35
>   Cr. Income Tax Expense (-E)             35 (100 x .35)
> ```
>
> **Is this negative Liability? Shouldn't this be a deferred tax asset?** No, this is not creating a negative liability. Remember, this is a change in depreciation assumptions. So presumably there is already been some depreciation, which we see in the cashflow statement. And so there's already a deferred tax liability there. We're just reducing the existing deferred tax liability.

If we change a non cash expense, it can't have any effect on cash operations. And the second is, we were able to just do depreciation add back on a pre tax basis because we take care of the tax effect in the change inferred taxes.

### Marketable Securities

---

> - **Gains or Losses on marketable securities are taxed only when they are sold**
>   - Tax is based on the difference between the sales price and the purchase price.
> - **Trading Securities**
>   - Unrealized gains/losses from market-to-market are carried on the Income Statement. To handle this we have to create a Deferred Tax Asset or Liability
> - **Available for Sale Securities**
>   - Unrealized gains/losses for AFS securities are stored up in AOCI
>   - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income must be carried on an after-tax basis. Create a DTA or DTL to reflect the tax effect of the unrealized gains/losses in AOCI

**I see a $20 loss on investment, but yet we have to pay $3 in taxes.** I agree it looks weird to have a loss on the income statement but yet we're paying taxes. But remember, last quarter when we marked this to market we booked a huge gain on the income statement, and over these two quarters on the income statement first we had an income tax expense of 10, then a negative tax expense of 7, which is a total tax of 3, which is exactly what we ended up paying to the IRS. So it's just a temporary difference that all works out by the end of the transaction by the time we sell the stock.
