## Introduction

---

> - There are 2 methods for allowance:

> **Percentage of sales method**:
>
> - Estimate bad debt expense directly
> - Multiply (total or credit(if you have credit sales)) sales by an estimated uncollectible percentage to compute bad debt expense
> - Plug in T-Account to solve for the ending balance of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
>
> In short, in percentage of sales method we take credit sales and multiply with a estimated percentage which is how much percent we except to never collect.

> **Aging of account receivable**:
>
> - Estimate ending balance of Allowance of Doubtful account directly
> - Multiply balance sheet A/R amounts by estimated uncollectible percentage (based on how long the A/R has been outstanding) to compute ending balance of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
> - Plug in T-Account to solve for Bad Debt Expense
>
> Aging of account receivable is called `aging method` based on how long a A/R is standing outside
>
> In real world companies can use either or both (take average) the methods. There are 2 methods because we have income statement and balance sheet

### Percentage of sales method

---

The formula is easy, but choosing a percentage is tricky, for that companies look at 3 factors:

> - their experience historically
> - what going on their industry and their competitors experience
> - what will happen in future

This percentage keeps on changing with future.

## A/R and Statement of Cash Flow

---

Cash flow effects of A/R

> - Cash collection of A/R are operating cash flow
> - Bad debt expense, write-offs and recoveries are `non cash transaction`

> - **2 methods for bad debt expense and indirect method**

> **First**
>
> - Add back debt expense (net of write-offs and recoveries)
> - Add/Subtract change in Gross A/R
>
> ```text
>    Cash from Operating Activities
>   ================================
>    Net Income
>    + Net Bad Debt Expense
>    +/- Change in Gross A/R
>   ================================
>   Cash flow from Operating Activities
> ```
>
> **Second**
>
> - Add/Subtract change in Net A/R (A/R net of noncash amounts)
>
> ```text
>   Cash from Operating Activities
>   ================================
>   Net Income
>
>   +/- Change in Net A/R
>   ================================
>   Cash flow from Operating Activities
> ```

## Collecting cash from Accounts Receivable more quickly

---

> **Pledging**:
> Use A/R as a colleteral for a loan. The firm retains the A/R and the risk of collection

> **Factoring**:
> Sell A/R to a financial institution at a discount that reflects an interest charge and risk of uncollectibility

> **Securitization**:
> Selling A/R to a separate legal entity (called a `Variable Interest Entity`) created for the exclusive purpose of securitization receivables. The VIE borrows money from investors and then uses the proceeds to buy the A/R from its parent.
