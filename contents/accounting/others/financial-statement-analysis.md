## Financial Statement Analysis Objectives

---

> **Evaluate Past Performance**
>
> - How has company fared in recent industry and market conditions?
> - How effective is the management and their strategy?

> **Predict Future Performance**
>
> - What is the `true` value of the company?
> - Can the company meet its future debt obligations?

## Financial Statement Analysis - Roadmap

---

> - What is the company's business, strategy and competitive environment?
> - Is the company growing?
> - What was the company's performance this year?
> - Is the company investing for the future?
> - What are it's debt obligations?
> - Are there significant `off balance sheet` items?

## Analysing Current Performance

---

> **Earnings**
>
> - Operating income, Net Income, EBITDA
> - Line items: Revenue, Margins
> - One-time items vs. persistent changes

> **Cash Flow**
>
> - Operating, Free Cash Flow

> **DuPont Analysis**
>
> - Source of advantages or problems

### Measures of Earnings

---

> - **Operating Earnings**: Revenues - Expense from core business
> - **Earnings - Continuing Ops**: Above - net interest expense +/- gains or losses from non-core items
> - **Net Earnings**: Above - Earnings from discounted operations
> - **Diluted EPS**: Net Earnings / Shares outstanding (adjusted for potential dilution)
> - Non-GAAP earnings (EBITDA)

### Margin Analysis

---

> - **Common Size income statement**: Divide everything by revenue
> - **Removes growth to allow time-series compairsons**
> - **Reveals your cost structure**: COGS vs SG&A vs Others
> - **Useful in forecasting financial statements for future periods**

## Issues with interpreting Cash Flows

---

> - Cash flow statement is completetly backwards looking
>   - Susceptible to timing issues
>   - No estimates of future activities (unlike earnings)
> - Cash from operations has no deduction for costs associated with capital investment
>   - Cash required for fixed assets shows up in cash from investing activities (but mismatch in timing)
>   - Need to look Free Cash Flow

**What do you mean when you say that cash flow has no estimates of future activities, unlike earnings? When does earnings have estimates of future activities?** Well the part about cash flow being backward looking is easy to see. It's simply a measure of how much cash did we collect last year. Minus how much cash we paid last year. Earnings has some backward looking features as well. But it has a lot of forward looking information embedded in it. For example. Depreciation is a function of how long you intend to hold the asset in the future and what the salvage value will be in the future. So those future estimates affect the depreciation number. Any time you book revenue before collecting cash, you're making a future estimate. You're trying to estimate how much of this revenue you're going to collect in cash in the future. And you make adjustments for allowance for doubtful accounts. So basically, on the income statement, any time we recognize a revenue or expense before the cash flow,. Or any time that we take a cost and spread it out over time, we're embedding future estimates into the earnings number. And as a result of this forward-looking aspect, earnings tends to be a better predictor of future cash flows than current cash flows, which has been borne out by decades of academic research.

So yes, free cash flow is a big driver of a lot of valuation models. But its future free cash flows. Not necessarily historic free cash flows. And if you look at Vulcan's case. A lot of the reason that they have free cash flow so high, is that they've been dramatically cutting their investment in property planning equipment. And it's in question of whether you can have free cash flow in the future. Whether you can continue to generate a lot of operating cash flow if you're not maintaining your level of investment going forward. And we'll look more at this level of investment in the next video. _But key thing to remember is it's all well and good to have high free cash flow historically but what really drives few, firm value is future free cash flow. And if you're drastically cutting investment for the future, I question whether you can have high free cash flow in the future_.

## Cash Flow vs Earnings

---

> **Earnings**
>
> - Did the company earn enough revenue to cover all costs of doing business?

> **Cash from Operations**
>
> - Did company collect more cash than it paid out during the period?

> **Both numbers are useful**
>
> - Earnings are better predictors of future cash flows
> - Cash flows are more objective measure of activity

## Allowance of Uncollectibles

---

> - During a recession, collections of receivable are a big concern
> - Measure trends either using:
>   - Balance Sheet: Allowance / Gross Account Receivable
>   - Income Statement: Bad Debt Expense / Net Sales

Bad debt expense is forward looking. It's managers looking ahead to see how much of their receivables they're going to be able to collect, which reflects their information about the credit quality of their customers, and where the business is going. And so this is one place where we get a little insight into what managers are thinking about the future.

## Analyzing Investment

---

> **Common Size Balance Sheet**
>
> - Express all numbers as a percent of Total Assets
> - Remove effects of growth in the balance sheet

> **What is the mix of working capital and long term assets?**
>
> - What are the trends in investment?

> **Cash Flows from investing activities**
>
> - Trend in recent investment

> **Are there large intangible assets that are not on the balance sheet?**

So the benchmark we want to use to figure out whether these capital expenditures are reasonable or not is often times depreciation. Now it makes sense to cut back on Capex during times that are really tough where their trying to conserve cash, but obviously though Company have to restart reinvesting in new property, plan, equipment if they want to continue to grow into the future. You can get away with this for a couple years, but what investors should want to see this turn around pretty quickly if they are going to see any kind of long term prospects for this company.

## Analyzing Debts

---

> - Cash flow from Investing Activities
>   - Trends in issuances and repayments
> - Debt Ratios
>   - Short-term liquidity
>   - Long-term leverage
> - Future debt servicing requirements
>   - Debt ratings
>   - Upcoming principal and interest payments
>   - Interest coverage ratios

### Short-term liquidity Ratios

---

```text
Current Ratio = Current Assets
                ------------------
                Current Liabilities
```

```text
Quick Ratio = Cash + Receivables
              --------------------
              Current Liabilities
```

> - Quick Ratios are more conservative (accurate) because it only includes high-liquid assets

### Long-term leverage Ratios

---

> - Also called capitalization ratios or leverage ratios
>   - How does the company finance its growth?
>   - What is bankruptcy risk?

```text
Debt to Equity = Total Liabilities
                 -----------------------
                 Shareholder's Equity
```

```text
Long-term Debt to Equity = Long Term Debt
                           ---------------------
                           Shareholder's Equity
```

**Total Assets is sometime used in the denominator**

Their **commercial paper** rates have gone up by 30 basis points. This was talked about in page 35. Commercial papers extremely short-term debt. So it's usually about 90 days, you're borrowing for about 90 days. And so this is the lowest risk borrowing that a company can really do. because all you need is the company to be there in 90 days to pay you back

### Interest Coverage

---

```text
Interest Coverage = Operating Expense
                    ------------------------
                    Interest Expense
```

> - Could also calculate this as: Operating Cash Flow over Interest Payments

## Off-Balance Sheet Items

---

> - Operating Leases
> - Pension Plans
> - Contingent Liabilities
>   - Commitments
>   - Lawsuits
>   - Guarantees
> - Variable Interest Entities
>   - No `off balance sheet arrangements`
