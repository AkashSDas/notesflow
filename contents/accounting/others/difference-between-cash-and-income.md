The difference between cash and income is very important to understand the difference between `cash flow statement` and `income statement`.

A **cash flow statement** shows the exact amount of a company's `cash inflows and outflows` over a period of time. The **income statement** shows the company's total `revenues and expenses`, including noncash accounting, such as depreciation over a period of time.

The `Financial Statements` for the year 2021 can be seen below, using this we can understand the difference between Cash and Income.

Consider the example of buying a House. You buy a house of $100 i.e. your asset where $40 is your money which will be your equity and $60 is the mortage from bank which will be your liablitiy.

Now let's say at the end of the year the value of your house increases to $200.

Now your balance sheet at the end of the year will have $200 in asset i.e. the house, $60 liability because the mortage doesn't change but now your equity will go from %40 to $140.

Now if you look at the statement that explains the changes in two balance sheets, none of this affects the `cash flow statement` because there's no cash impact of your house going up in value. In fact, your cash up should probably went down as you were paying the mortgage, but your income statement would show a gain of $100 from the increase in your equity due to your ownership claim of the house.
