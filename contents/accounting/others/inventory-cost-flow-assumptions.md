## Inventory Cost Flow Assumptions

**For Specific Identification with computer technology today, I think companies should have to keep t-accounts for each individual good. Give me a compelling reason why any method other than Specific Identification should be used?**: Here's a compelling reason. What if you made toothpaste or a salad dressing, where you're taking gallons of liquids and chemicals and mixing them together in a big vat and drain things out the other side. How do you keep track of the, costs with specific ounce of toothpaste or salad dressing? In that case, you would need some kind of cost flow assumption. And even with more discrete products, and with today's computer technology. It would still take a lot of time and effort to keep track of these individual costs of individual products when you're making thousands or millions of products. The fact of the matter is that the costful assumptions we'll talk about will get you pretty close to the same answer anyway, without all the time or effort. Well, that is unless you use LIFO, which we'll talk about in a little bit.

> - In practice, weighted average ends up giving results that look a lot like FIFO.

## Example

---

> - LIFO versus FIFO can effect Cost of Goods Sold and Ending Inventory.

**How can you get different numbers for COGS? COGS is COGS. It is what it is. You are telling me that a simple accounting choice can have such a big effect on profits?**:

> - Well, for COGS, you can't use the old, it is what it is, because every time you look at Cost of Goods Sold on the income statement, you're looking at a number that's the product of cost flow assumptions.
> - And if the company used a different set of assumptions, they would have a different Cost of Goods Sold number. There's no true answer to what Cost of Goods Sold is, it's always a product of assumptions. And this is just one of many cases that we're going to look at in this course, where a very `simple accounting choice can have a very dramatic effects on the balance sheet and the income statement`.

**It simply is not plausible that companies could have such different values on the same goods in inventory! LIFO must require you keep the older goods!**: This does happen in the real world. LIFO became popular in the US sometime after World War II and if you look at companies that have been around since the 40's. You could see costs in their Ending Inventory from the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, so some really old costs. But it's very unlikely that they still have goods from that long ago still in their inventory. Well, maybe if they're a US automaker, they still have some cars from the 40's that haven't sold. But for most companies, the goods are long gone. But don't worry about this problem of really all cost and inventory. In the next video, I'll show you a disclosure, which will allow you to see the inventory using more recent costs for LIFO firms.

**So when a company says it is having a liquidation sale, does that refer to LIFO inventory?**: Not, not necessary. A liquidation sale simply means that you're trying to sell excess inventory. We use the term LIFO liquidation because it occurs when you sell more inventory than you produce, which often happens during a liquidation sale. But you can have a liquidation sale, even if you don't use LIFO for your inventory.

## Why does it matter whether firms use FIFO or LIFO?

---

It all cancels out over the three years. So you might be thinking, well what difference does it make? You save some taxes now, you pay some taxes later. But, it's the case that a Dollar today is always worth more than a Dollar in the future. And we'll talk about this later in the course when we talk about time value of money, but you always want to save taxes today. And be willing to pay taxes in the future, because the value of what you save today is worth more than what you're going to save in the future.

> - If you ever have to compare a US firm to a non-US firm. And the US firm uses LIFO. There's some adjustments you need to make to get a reasonable comparison.
