## What are adjusting entries?

---

Adjusting journal entries are used to **record transactions that have occurred but have not yet been appropriately recorded in accordance with the accrual method of accounting**. This ususally happens at the end of an accounting period. Adjusting journal entries can also refer to financial reporting that corrects a mistake made previously in the accounting period. Adjusting journal entries are recorded in a company's general ledger

An adjusting journal entry involves an income statement account (revenue or expense) along with a balance sheet account (asset or liability). The most common types of adjusting journal entries are `accruals`, `deferrals`, and `estimates`.

## Deferred revenues and expenses

---

You have to ask the right question in order to recognize deferred expenses or revenues.

### Deferred expenses

---

Question: Are there any `assets` that have been used up this period and should be expensed?

> **Examples**
>
> - Prepaid Rent
> - Prepaid Insurance
> - Depreciation or Amortization

```text
Journal Entry:
Debit Expense
    Credit Prepaid Asset
```

### Deferred revenues

---

Question: Are there any `liabilities` that have been fulfilled by delivery of goods/services that should be recognized as revenue?

> **Example**
>
> - Unearned rental revenue
> - Deferred subscription revenue

```text
Journal Entry:
Debit Unearned Revenue Liability
    Credit Revenue
```

## Accured revenues and expenses

---

You have to ask the right question in order to recognize accured expenses or revenues.

### Accured expenses

---

Question: Have any `expenses accumulated` during the period that have not yet been recorded?

> **Example**
>
> - Income taxes payable
> - Interest payable
> - Salaires and wages payable

```text
Journal Entry:
Debit Expense
    Credit Payable Liability
```

### Accured revenues

---

Question: Have any `revenues accumulated` during the period that have not yet been recorded?

> **Example**
>
> - Interest Receivable
> - Rent Receivable

```text
Journal Entry:
Debit Receivable Asset
    Credit Revenue
```

## Depreciation and Amortization

---

Allocate the original cost of a long lived asset over its useful life and it is the total cost of asset to the revenues it generates over its period of use.

> **Terminology**
>
> - Tangible assets (physical assets) require depreciation
> - Intangible assets (abstract assets) require amortization

### Amount Procedure

---

Depreciation is not deducted from the tangible asset account, rather its recorded in a `Contra Asset Account (XA)` called `Accumulated Depreciation` which has credit balance and is subtracted from PP&E on the balance sheet to get the `net book value`. Amortization is often (but not always) deducted directly from the intangible asset account.

### Straight-line Depreciation

---

> - Depreciation Expense = (Original Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
