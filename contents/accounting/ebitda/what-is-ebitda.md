EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is often used as a proxy for `cash flow that excludes interest and taxes`.

However EBITDA does not measure cash flow well if there are large changes in working capital and suffers from the same manipulation potential as net income. For example, "channel stuffing" would increase earnings and EBITDA but no cash is collected (instead accounts receivable increases). Subtracting the increase in A/R from EBITDA would correct this problem.

Research finds that Earnings are a better predictor of future cash flow than current cash flow from operation. But using both gives the best prediction.
