## Introduction

Free cash flow is tricky because its **not part of generally accepted accounting principles**, so compaines can come up with their `own formula` for free cash flow, but its important to know this numbers before buying a company.

In simple words, **free cash flow is the amount of cash you will get back in your pocket if you own the company**. There are many business's that have a very good net earnings but have no free cash flow because they use all of their money in the business either to stay competitive or just to survive. Eg. car companines.

> **There are two things look when it comes to free cash flow**
>
> - Is there any free cash flow?
> - If yes then what the company is doing with it?

In cash flow statement when you subtract `Operating cash flow` from `Long term investment (PPE)` you will get free cash flow

Exmple, if a company has $1000 cash flow from operating and only $100 is used to pay for PPE the we are left with $900 that we can use how ever we want. We can use it allocate in other parts of the business or have fun with it. Another example, if a company has $1000 cash flow from operating and uses $900 for PPE, so we are left with $100 of cash in our pocket.

So our investment is good in example 1 but not in example 2 and this is the reason why we should know the free cash flow of a company because it makes us ask the right questions regarding the business and their operations and using that we can make better decisions.
