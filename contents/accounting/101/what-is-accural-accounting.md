The word accural means the accumulation or increase of something over time, especially payments or benefits. Where as the term accural method of accounting or accural accounting as we say, is the method in which `the recognition of revenues/expenses are tied to business activities and not to cash flows`.

Revenues are recognized when the goods/services are sold and not when the cash is received. Revenue is not equal cash inflow. Expenses are recognized in the same period as revenues they helped to generate (Matching Principle). Expense is not equal cash outflow. Net income is not equal net cash flow.
