## Definition of Accounting

---

Accounting is a system of recording business transactions to provide summary statements of a company's position and performance to users who require such information.

Since different user groups wants different information, most companies have to keep 3 different sets of books.

> - **Financial accounting** - Standarized reports for external stakeholders
> - **Tax accounting** - IRS rules for computing taxes payable
> - **Managerial accounting** - Custom reports for internal decision making

## The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires periodic financial statement filings

---

> - **10 K - Annual report** - Companies must file an annual report, or 10-K once a year. This includes a full set of financial statements with a substantial amount of additional disclosure. This thing generally runs 200-300 pages.
> - **10 Q - Quaterly report** - The other three-quarters of the year, firms must file a quarterly report, or 10-Q, which has a full set of financial statements but less required disclosure than the annual report.
> - **8 K - Current report (material event)** - If anything material happens between quarter ends, companies must file an 8K, or current report. Material information is generally viewed as anything important enough to move stock price, which means companies file these quite often. They don't require the financial statements, just an update of whatever major corporate event has happened, something like a top manager resigns or you lose a big customer or there's a lawsuit or something along those lines.
> - All of these filings have to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or `GAAP`.

Every country in the world that has a securities market has filing requirements like an annual report. The only difference you might see internationally is instead of a quarterly report, some countries require semi-annual reporting. This also only formally applies to public companies. But private companies that need to go to a bank to borrow money oftentimes are required to provide financial statements on a quarterly or annual frequency because the banks are so used to getting financial statement information in that format and in that frequency. So this is a pretty universal set of filing requirements that apply to public and private companies around the world.

### Periodic filings requirments create much of the tension in financial accounting

---

For example:

> - Let's say we ship goods to a customer in one quarter, but we collect cash in the next quarter. When did the sale occur? Was it when we shipped the goods or collected the cash?
> - Let's say we buy some equipment in one quarter, and then use it to manufacture goods over the next 23 quarters. When does the expense occur? When we pay cash to buy the equipment or as we use it over the next 23 quarters?

## Who makes these rules?

---

> - Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) established by:
>   - U.S. Congress, but they delegate to:
>   - The SEC, but they delegate to:
>   - Financial Standard Accounting Board (FSAB)
>     - Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
>     - American Institue Of CAP's (AICPA)

> - International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are establised by the IASB and are required in over 100 countries
>   - US GAAP is still required for US firms
>   - For intro accounting topics, there is a high degree of overlap in the two standards

## Who is responsible for financial reporting?

---

> - Management is responsible for perparing financial statements
>   - The Audit committee of the Board of Directors provide oversight of management's process (This is not full proof, so...)
>   - The Auditors are hired by the Board to `express an opinion` about whether the statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP (This is also not full proof, so...)
> - **The SEC and other regulators takes action against the firm if any violations of GAAP or other rules are found** Now these bodies tends to be very reactive then proactive and its often times that someone else has brought the fraud in public's attention that they have launch their investigation. So by and large, it's **information intermediaries** like stock analysts, institutional investors and the media that provide the biggest check on managers' behavior by either exposing or fleeing firms with questionable accounting. But by the time one of these parties get involved, it's a very public issue, the stock price drops and you're in bad shape if you're an investor or employee of the company. So in the end, the only party that's really going to look out for your interest in terms of understanding and trusting financial statements is you.

## What are required financial statements?

---

> - **Balance Sheet** - Financial position (listing of resources and obligations) on a specific date.
> - **Income Statement** - Results of operations over a period of time using `accural accounting` (i.e. recognition tied to business activities). By `over a period of time` means between two balace sheets (quater or year)
> - **Statement of Cash Flow** - Sources and uses of cash of a period of time.
> - **Statement of Stockholder's Equity** - Changes in stockholder's equity over a period of time.
