## Introduction

There are 3 main financial statements `balance sheet`, `income statement` and `cash flow statement`. A balance sheet shows what a company owns and what it owes at a fixed point in time.

The stuff the business owns are **Assets** and the stuff the business owes are broken into 2 components namely **Liabilities** (from third parties) and **Equity**. The `accounting equation` also called the balance sheet equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

By using the accounting equation we can also say that `the balance sheet is a snapshot of a business's assets, liabilities and equity at a point in time`. Also balance sheet equation is the foundation for the double-entry bookkeeping system since for each transaction `the total debits equal the total credits`.

Changes over a period between 2 balance sheets are summarized in the income statement, statement of stockholder's equity and statement of cash flows.

The equation can be represented by the below equation too.

> - Resources = Claims on resources by outsiders + Owner

When you keep on expanding the equity term in the accounting equation you will see that the 2 of the business's major financial statements i.e. the `income statement` and the `balance sheet` are linked together by `equity`.

## Example

Buying a house is a good example for the use of balance sheet equation. Below the accounting equation balances as `$100 (asset) = $60 (liability) + $40 (equity)`
