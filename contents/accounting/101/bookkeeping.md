## Definitions

> - **Account**: Is a place where we can record, sort and store all transactions that affect a related group of items.

> - **T-Account**: Is a visual representation of an account and it looks like a T.

> - **General Ledger**: Is a place where a business stores a complete record of all its financial transactions and accounts.

> - **Double Entry Bookkeeping**: Every accounting entry has an opposite, corresponding entry in a different account. To record a transaction you need to write down both sides of it in at least two T-Accounts.

## Fundamental bookkeeping equations

---

> - Assets = Liablities + Equity
> - Sum of Debits = Sum of Credits
> - Beginning account balance + Increases - Decreases = Ending account balance

The equations above balance at all times. Also balance sheet equation can be preserved through the use debits and credits. In bookkeeping think of `debits(Dr.) = Left-side entry` and `credits(Cr.) = Right-side entry`.

## Debit/Credit Bookkeeping

---

Let's break the balance sheet equation to get all debits and credits

> - Assets = Liablities + Equity
> - Assets = Liablities + Retained Earnings + Revenues - Expenses
> - Assets + Expenses = Liabilities + Retained Earnings + Revenues
> - Debits = Credits

### Rules of Debits and Credits

---

> - Every transaction must have atleast one debit and atleast one credit
> - Debits must equal credits for all transactions
> - No negative numbers are allowed

## Accounts and Account Balances

---

> - **Normal Balance**: This type of balance (debit/credit) the account carries under normal circumstances

> - **T Account**: It is record of all changes in an accounting quantity. Debits are listed on the left side of the T. Credits are listed on the right side of the T.

> - **Account Balance**: Difference between sum of debits and sum of credits for the account.

> - **Change in Account Balance Equation**: Beginning account balance + Increases - Decreases = Ending account balance

## Normal Balances and T-accounts

---

### For Debits (Assets, Expenses)

---

> - Normal Balance is debit (left side of T)
> - Increases through Debits (left side entries)
> - Decreases through Credits (right side entries)
> - Beginning (Debit) Balance + Debits - Credits = Ending (Debit) Balance

## Analyzing Transactions & Journal Entries

---

**Three questions in analyzing transactions**:

> - Which specific asset, liablity, equity, revenues or expenses accounts does the transaction affect?
> - Does the transaction increases/decreases the affected accounts?
> - Should the accounts be debited/credited?
