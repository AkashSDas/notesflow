## Revenues

---

Revenues are earned from `sales of goods` and `provision of services`. Revenue is recognized when it is `earned` not when cash is received. Revenue is also recognized when it is `realized` i.e. when we receive payment in cash or something that can be converted into cash for goods/services.

> **Examples**:
>
> Let's say we receive a prepayment of $100 in the month of Nov to provide sugar to one of our client and we gave them the sugar in the month of Dec then the revenue will be recivied at month Dec even though we received cash at Nov.
>
> Let's say we sold vegetables of $100 to a client in the month of Dec but client will do the payment in the month of Jan but the revenue will be recognized in the month of Dec since we sold the vegetable than.

Revenue can also be understood as increase in shareholder's equity (not necessarily cash) from providing goods/services.

## Expenses

---

Expenses are the decrease in the shareholder's equity (not necessarily cash) that aries in the process of generating revenue. Expenses are recognized when related revenues are recognized i.e. in the form of `product cost`.

Expenses are recognized when it is incurred, if it is difficult to match with revenues and that will be in the form of `period cost` or `unusal events`. Incurred means that all transactions, regardless of their nature, must be recorded when they occur.

The `Match Making Principle (product vs period)` and `Conservatism Principle (unusal events)` are used to recognize expenses

> The **Conservatism Principle (unusal events)**: Recognize anticipated losses immediately, recognize anticipated gains only when realized.

### Period cost

---

It refers to all those costs which are not related or tied with the production process of the company i.e., they are not assigned with any of the particular product of the company and are thus shown in the financial statement of the company for the accounting period in which they are incurred.

In short, all `costs that are not involved in the production of a product` (product costs) are period costs. Period costs are costs that cannot be capitalized on a companyâ€™s balance sheet. In other words, they are expensed in the period incurred and appear on the income statement. Period costs are also called `period expenses`.

Examples: selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, marketing expenses, CEO salary, and rent expense relating to the corporate office. The costs are not related to the production of inventory and are therefore expensed in the period incurred.

### Product cost

---

It is the costs related to the production of a product and is capitalized on the balance sheet as inventory and eventually expensed to cost of goods sold on the income statement.

Examples: Direct labor, direct materials, and manufacturing overhead
