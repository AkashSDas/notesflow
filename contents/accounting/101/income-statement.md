## Introduction

---

An income statemenet is the summary of a business's revenues and expenses over a period of time. It is also called as `Profit & Loss statement` or `P&L` for short

When we subtract our Revenues with Expenses i.e `revenues - expenses` we get our Profit/Loss. We have a profit when our revenues are greater than expenses or loss on other way round. But this description is not very descriptive since a business can have many types of revenues, the same goes for expenses. The expenses can be broken down into two categories, a `Direct Cost` for doing business and `Indirect Cost` of running a business

## Direct Costs

---

These costs can be traced back to the production of goods/services. For business that provides services, this direct cost will be called as `cost of service` and revenue will be `services rendered` or if the business sells goods then the direct cost will be `cost of product` and revenue will be `product sales`.

Direct cost for sales are variable which is driectly proportional to the sales we make.

When we take our revenues and deduct the direct cost of doing business then we get our `Gross Profit/(Loss)`. The Gross Profit/(Loss) is a good tool that allows us to measure the efficiency of our production and sales process.

## Indirect Costs

---

These costs can't be traced back to the production of goods/services. These are sometimes also called as `overheads` and they can be fixed or variable. They are of 2 types: `Indirect Fixed Costs` and `Indirect Variable Costs`.

**Indirect Fixed Costs**: Costs like this tends to remain same i.e. their is no correlation between cost and sales

**Indirect Variable Costs**: Not all overheads are fixed, variable overheads can lossely be correlate cost and sales, although they can't be traced back to the production of goods/services.

## Operating Profit

---

`Operating profit` measures the net income that we generated from operations. This is the residual amount that's leftover after deducting all of our direct and indirect costs of doing business.

## Comparing financial preformance against comparative periods

---

The below figure shows the basic income statement:

Comparative periods can be any two periods. eg. this month vs last month, this year vs last year, etc...

For an example let's consider a medium size company.

What can we learn from the above comparison, our sales has increase by $10,000 but our gross profit has remained exactly the same. To understand this behaviour we can use a metric called `Gross Profit Margin`.

Using the metric we can see that `gross profit margin` in the current year is 63.64% while in previous year that was 70%. But how can that be possible...well 1 of 2 reasons can be happening 1) our sales might be shrinking 2) our cost could be rising, we could be selling more products but at a discount or the cost of our raw material might be rising.

## Advance Income Statement

---

> There are other indirect cost of doing business that we might want to include in the income statement:
>
> - Interest Expense
> - Tax Expense

These are below operating profit since they are not considered as cost of operation and that's why `Operating Profit` are also known as `EBIT (Earnings Before Interest & Tax)`.

When we deduct our Interest & Tax from our Operating Profit we get our `Net Profit` also called the `Bottom Line` since it is at the bottom of P&L statement.

So gross profit is our `Top Line` profit, after deducting overheads we get our EBIT/Operating profit and deducting Interest & Tax from EBIT we get our net profit i.e. the bottom line.
