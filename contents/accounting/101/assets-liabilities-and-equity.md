## Assets

---

Assets are probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions or events. `Future economic benefits` means the value that is brought by the asset directly or indirectly to your company.

### Future Economic Benefits

---

Valuing assets by their future economic benefits means we can't simply hold them in the books the values that they originally cost us.

Consider a phone that you plan on using, will that same phone carry the same future economic benefit for let's say next 5years? may be not, maybe an asteroid fell on it and it will be worth nothing, so its hard to measure the life of a phone or for that matter any product.

Since its hard to calculate the life span of a product and then estimate its future economic benefit instead we use the term `useful economic life` i.e. how long an asset will remain useful to you which is not the same as asset's actual life. It's an estimate. For this we use the term `depreciation`.

Let's go back to the phone example and let's say we bought it for $100, we will depreciate its value by $20/year using the `straight line depreciation` and at the end of the 5th year the phone will be of cost $0.

> - There is no science in it but esitmates like this help accounts to simplfy the secnario and value assets.

### Substance Over Form

---

The part `obtained or controlled by a particular entity` in the assets definition highlights one of the important concepts in accounting `substance over form`, this means when preparing financial statements we priotize the **economic substance** of transaction over their legal form.

For example consider a business rents a building for long period of time let's say 60 years and that buildings remaining useful economic benefit is 65 years, although doesn't owns the building technically but in some sense it owns the building because they have the right to use it for majority of its remaining useful economic benefit.

Following the principle of substance over form we can account for this building as an asset even though legally it isn't, this does have big implications for the accounting and tax treatment of the building. This is an over-simiplification of the situation and there are other few factors consider when making this call.

### Types of Assets

---

The balance sheet is a snapshot of business's assets, liabilites and equity at a point in time.

> - Assets = Liabilities + Equity

In the asset section of the balance sheet equation we list all of the assets that company owns/controlls in a decreasing order of their `liquidity` (how quickly you can turn asset into cash). Following the vein of thought the assets can be divided into `Current Assets` and `Non-current Assets`.

#### Current Assets

---

These are assets that can be converted to cash in short time (typically a year). Example of current assets in decreasing order of their liquidity are listed below:

> - Cash
> - Account receivable
> - Inventory
> - Prepayments
> - Short term investment

#### Non-current Assets

---

These assets are long term assets that are used in operations to generate profits and can't easily be converted into cash. Example of current assets in decreasing order of their liquidity are listed below:

> - Long-term investment
> - Tangible assets(PPE, etc...)
> - Non-tangible assets(intellectual property)
> - Goodwill (other than intellectual property

## Liability

---

Liabilities are probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations of a particular entity to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions or events.

In simple words liablities are `future sacrifies of economic benefits` are needed to be estimated from `present obligation` (eq. loan) to transfer assets/service (eq. interest/captial payment on/for that loan) to other entities (eq. bank) in the future as a result of past transactions/event (eq. loan given by the bank).

Using `balance sheet equation` (Assets = Liabilities + Equity), a business has two core sources while buying an asset those are **liabilies** or **equity**.

### Types of Liabilites

---

The balance sheet is a snapshot of business's assets, liabilites and equity at a point in time.

> - Assets = Liabilities + Equity

In the liability section of the balance sheet equation we list all of the liabilites that company owes in a decreasing order of their `due dates`. Following the vein of thought the liabilites can be divided into `Current Liabilities` and `Non-current Liabilities`.

#### Current liabilities

---

Business obligations that are needed to settled down within a year from now are called current liabilities.

> - Account payable
> - Salaries payable
> - Tax payable
> - Interest payable
> - Accurals
> - Unearned revenue (opposite of prepayment)
>   - Since this is double entry bookkeeping therefore it is an liability
> - Short term loans
>   - loans that have to be paid within a year
>   - portions of long term loans

**Unearned revenue** is money received by an individual or company for a service or product that has yet to be provided or delivered.

#### Non current liabilities

---

Business obligations that aren't excepted to be settled within a year from now are called non-current liabilities.

> - Long term loans
> - Bonds
> - Mortages
> - Employee pensions
> - Deferred income tax

#### Contingent liabilities

---

These are less common than the other two but are worth being aware of them.

Example of this is - assume that a company is facing a lawsuit from a rival firm for patent infringement. The company's legal department thinks that the rival firm has a strong case, and the business estimates a $2 million loss if the firm loses the case. Because the liability is both probable and easy to estimate, the firm posts an accounting entry on the balance sheet to debit (increase) legal expenses for $2 million and to credit (increase) accrued expense for $2 million.

Below figure will tell you what to do in certian situation:

## Equity

---

Equity is the residual value of an entity's assets after deducting all it's liabilities,

> - Equity = Assets - Liabilities

So equity is the `net asset`. This defination is correct but it doesn't explains what equity is actually. So another definition of equity is given below which explain equity in a much meaningful manner. Equity represents the net funds invested into a business by its owners. It is also called `net worth`, `net assets` and `net book value`.

### Sources of shareholder's equity

---

> **Contributed captial (aries from sale of shares)**
>
> - Common stock (par value)
> - Additional paid-in-capital (excess over par value)
> - Treasury stock (stock repurchased by company)

> **Retained earnings (aries from operations)**
>
> - Accumulation of `net income (= Revenues - Expenses)`, less dividends, since start of business.
> - `Retained Earnings (at end) = Retained Earnings (at beginning) + Net Income - Dividends`

> **Dividends**
>
> - Dividends are distributions of retained earnings to shareholders. They are not consider as an expense to the company. Recorded as a reduction of retained earnings on the declaration date (creates a liability until payment date)

### Understanding equity

---

Equity is a tricky one not because of its concepts but the different words used to describe the same thing.

### Link between balance sheet and income statement

---

When you keep on expanding the equity term in the accounting equation you will see that the 2 of the business's major financial statements i.e. the `income statement` and the `balance sheet` are linked together by `equity`.
