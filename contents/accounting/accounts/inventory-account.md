## Inventory Cost Flow for Manufacturing Firms

---

Manufacturing firm creates the inventory instead of buying it. Accounting for manufacturing firms is `similar to retail firm` with some small changes.

Once the raw materials start being used to produce goods, we take its cost out of raw material account and move them to `work in progress`.

There no transaction with outsiders, its an internal transaction and it is done like `adjusting entries`, since you'll get tired of moving raw materials to workin progress and it doesn't matter until you are preparing financial statement. When you are doing adjusting entires, that time you'll see how many materials used in production.

As we produce the product we'll have more stuff in `work in progress` like `labour` & `overhead`. Overhead is any cost that is not `cost of goods` or labour, example cost of electricity bill in factories, depreciation on any machinery used in production, etc...

**Journal entry for depreciation is always debit deprecation expense and credit accumulated depreciation. Until we get to inventory for manufacturing firms.** So depreciation on machinery equipment is a product cost. Remember, product cost gets stored up in inventory until we sell the product. Then when we recognize revenue from sale, we take the cost of the products sold out of inventory, and show them as costs have been sold expense on the income statement. So for depreciation that should be product costs, the way we get into inventory is to debit work in process inventory. If we debited depreciation expense, it would put it on the income statement immediately, which is not what we want in this case. We would only debit depreciation expense immediately if it was a period cost, so a selling general and administrative cost like, say, the depreciation on the CEO's Jaguar. But if it's part of a product cost, it needs to go into work in process inventory.

So the `finished goods account` is what we have been calling the `inventory account` in by far. Except, instead of the inventory balance being the cost of purchasing inventory, the balance is the cost of manufacturing the inventory.

> - You don't have to keep a T account for every individual good that you produce. Instead we have to make some assumptions about what were the costs of the goods that we just sold.

So what this flow chart should highlight is that these costs flow through a lot of different accounts as we go from cash and accounts payable for raw materials, all the way to the costs of the goods sold. And by using these different accounts, we're able to see the costs that are locked up in each of the different stages of the manufacturing process.

## Inventory and COGS

---

We can know how many goods we sold vs how many goods we have in our inventory.

**Do companies really count every single piece of inventory just so they can calculate COGS? It seems much easier to track what you sell?**: Even if companies use some of this new fangled computer technology to track goods that they sell as they sell them, they still need to count their inventory at least once a year. They need to count their inventory so that they can track what we call none revenue sales, which a non accountant would call theft. So if a customer or employee steals inventory, their not going to let the computer system know about it as they walk out the door. The only way that youÂ´re going to track theft is to count the inventory at least once a year, and then write down the inventory for any inventory that's disappeared due to theft or some other kind of way that inventory disappears.

> - The periodic versus perpetual system helps you figure out the number of goods you've sold versus the number of goods you still have. But in terms of what the actual cost you need to assign to those goods are, well, you have to make some additional assumptions.

## Inventory Valuation: Lower of cost or market

**How do you determine the replacement value of the inventory? Is this a number that accountants just make up off the top of their head?**: Actually, management is responsible for making up this number off the top of her head. So clearly, replacement value is not going to be an exact number. But, management should be in a good position to come up with a reasonable estimate for how much it would cost to re-manufacture the product, or re-acquire the product, given current prices. And if that value is below the original cost, they need to take a write down. So even though we can't get an exact value for replacement value, any estimate is going to be better than ignoring it completely when it's clear the value of the inventory has dropped below what we show it on the balance sheet.
