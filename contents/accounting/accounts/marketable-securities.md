## Intercorporate Investments

---

Investment in equity (stock) or debt (bonds) of another company. In this case the accounting treatment depends on influence and intent.

> - **Small investment** in equity (less than 20%, here you won't have much controll) or investments in debt. These assets are called as **Marketable Securities (A)**. Three methods: Trading and Available for sale (both for stocks) and Held to Maturity (debt only).

> - **Strategic investments** in equity (20% to 50% or `significant influence`). These are called as **Investment in Affiliates (A)** and here we have two methods: Equity method and Fair value accounting.

> - **Control investment** (greater than 50%) which means that you could outvote all the other shareholders and basically decide what the other company does. Here there's just one method full consolidation where you add up all the assets, liabilities of the other company and then recognize this thing called non-controlling interest for the part that you don't own.

**Why don't all equity investments go into stockholders' equity? And why don't all the debt investments go in to notes payable?** So when we issue equity, raise money with equity, that's common stock. When we buy another company's stock, so we're on the other side of the transaction, it's an investment asset. Similarly, if we borrow money by issuing a bond, it's not payable, but if we're in the other side of the transaction buying another company's bond, then it's an investment asset.

Here in this post only **Marketable Securities** with its three methods is discussed.

## Marketable Securities: Equity

---

Equity investments of less than 20% ownership in another firm are treated based on the **intent** in making investment.

> **Trading Securities**
>
> - Intent is to profit in the short-term fluctuations in market prices (active management)
> - Common in financial services firms and financial services divisions

> **Available for Sale Securities (AFS)**
>
> - Intent is to earn returns over the medium-to-long term (invest excess cash until needed for new project)
> - Common in non-financial firms

**Intent, this whole accounting choice is based on intent? How does the manager know his intent? What if he changes his mind?** This is sort of weird that we have managers' intentions dictating how this is accounted for. But little history will show that this really came about as a compromise. So when the FASB first proposed putting marketable securities at fair value on the balance sheet. Your idea was that the unrealized gains and losses would just go on the income statement. That was fine for financial services firms, which viewed trading and marketable securities as a core part of their business and so it made sense to have it on the income statement. You had a number of non financial firms, some regular companies. They were holding these securities, they did not want their income to now show the volatility of these unrealized gains and losses over time. So there was a compromise where basically if you wanted to show these unrealized gains or losses in income. You could, we call that method trading securities. If you don't want to show these unrealized gains and losses in your income, you want to keep that volatility out of your income statement, we've got a method for you, as well, called available for sale securities. So that's really where the two methods came from, and it really breaks down to almost a financial versus non-financial categorization. Although many financial firms still have some AFS and some non, non financial firms have trading. As far as changing method, you are allowed to change the classification of the securities if you change your intent.

## Trading vs AFS

---

> **Balance Sheet**
>
> - Both methods, investment carried at fair value at the balance sheet date (`market-to-market`)
> - Market-to-market creates unrealized gains or losses

Under both methods, the investment's going to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet date, or as people say, mark to market. So if you held shares of stock in another company like, let's say, Microsoft. At the balance sheet date you'd have to look at the stock price of Microsoft use that to figure out the market value of your investment. That's what would show up on the balance sheet date. Now what that's going to create is unrealized gains or losses. Unrealized gains or losses are where you get a gain or loss on holding the security. But it's a paper gain, or I guess now a days an electronic gain. You still hold the stock, it's still holding the gain or loss, you haven't realized it.

> - Now these unrealized gains or losses are important because this is where the two methods are going to differ.

> **Income Statement**
>
> - Trading - Unrealized gains/losses go on the Income Statement
> - AFS - Unrealized gains/losses go into **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income**
>   - AOCI is like a Retained Earnings account, except that transactions go directly into AOCI without appearing on the Income Statement
> - AOCI `stores up` unrealized gains/losses until security is sold, when they are `reversed out` into the income statement
> - Key disclaimer: Transactions go into AOCI net of taxes

So AOCI is like a retained earnings account, in fact look, the words are sort of similar so instead of retained, we say accumulated, instead of earnings we say comprehensive income, which sort us downs like earnings,. But the difference is that transactions go directly in an AOCI without appearing on the income statement.

So think back to, how we do things that go on the income statement, like a trading security gain would go on the income statement. Into net income, and then net income would go into retained earnings. For available for sale, this unrealized gain or loss is going to go directly into AOCI without showing up on the income statement. So either way it goes into stockholders' equity. Stock holders equity would go up with an unrealized gain. The difference is with AOCI, it doesn't have to go through the income statement, like it does with retained earnings.

Think of AOCI as the FASB's attic. You know how a house will have an attic, like a storage room up near the roof, where you have something that you don't know what to do with now. You store it in the attic until you need it later. Well, that's essentially how AOCI functions, is you have this unrealized gain or loss. It has to go into stockholder's equity, because otherwise your balance sheet equation won't balance. But you don't want it to go through the normal income statement retrained earnings channel, so instead, we take this unrealized gain or loss and stored in AOCI. Stored in the attic until we need it, and then when we need it, we take it out of AOCI and run it through the income statement into retained earnings.

## Difference between Trading and AFS

---

> **There's no difference when**
>
> - Purchase of investment
> - Receive Dividends

> **There's difference when**
>
> - Market-to-Market on Balance Sheet date - Unrealized gains/losses is a part of Net Income for Trading and bypasses Net Income of AFS
> - Sale of Investment - Realized gains/losses is based on last balance sheet value for Trading and based on original cost for AFS

The IRS taxes only realized gains. So you're only taxed on a gain or loss when you sell the stock. So companies will actually pay identical taxes if they have identical realized gains. So these unrealized gains are relevant for tax purposes. They're going to create something called **deferred taxes**.

## Marketable Securities: Debt

---

Debt investments are can be accounted for as trading, available-for-sale (AFS) or **held-to-maturity** securities.

> **Held-to-Maturity (HTM)**
>
> - Firm has both the ability and intent to hold the debt investment until it matures.
> - Do not market-to-market
> - Recognize interest revenue each period

**There are two methods for equity investments, and three for debt investments. Why can't equity investments be considered held to maturity?** The simple answer is that equity does not mature. So when we're talking about these debt securities, oftentimes they have a fixed maturity. So you get paid back in five years, or ten years, or 30 years, whereas equity, there's no kind of fixed maturity at which point you get paid back. So when the first view was coming up with these methods, there was a demand for a third method, where firms said, look, sometimes we buy five year bonds. We intend to hold the bond for five years, collect interest, and then principal at the end. So, who cares about this fair value stuff? And the FASB said, okay, as long as you're willing to hold the bond for five years, we'll create a third category where you don't have to mark things to market.

## Statement of Cash Flow Effects on Marketable Securities

---

> **Trading Securities**
>
> - Operating activities
> - Add decreases (or subtract increases) in balance sheet account in Cash Flow from Operation section (i.e. treat just like Account Receivable and Inventory)

> **Available-for-Sale** or **Held-to-Maturity** securities
>
> - Investing activities
> - Cash for purchases and from sales is listed in the Cash Flow from Investing Activies section
> - Add back realized losses (or subtract realized gains) in Cash Flow from Operations section (i.e. treat just like PP&E)

So if you decide to classify your investment as a trading security, and then it's going to be considered an operating activity. It's going to be considered part of your core operations, which makes sense because most of the companies that choose this are financial institutions and that's part of their business. So in that case, we're going to add decreases or subtract increases in the balance sheet account, marketable securities, in the cash and operations section. The way to think about it is it's going to work just like accounts receivable and inventory work on the cash flow statement.

If we choose available for sale or held to maturity, those are going to be investing activities. So, cash and purchases, cash from sales are going to be in the cash flow from investing activities section. So it's going to not be part of the core business and operations but be considered part of investing activities.

We have to add back realized losses or subtract realized gains in the cash room operations sections, because those will affect that income, but we want the cash flow to be reflected in investing. So, we have to pull them out to, it's treated just like property plant equipment. All the transactions that we did for property plant equipment, and how this showed up in the cash flow statement, will also work like that for available-for-sale and for held-to-maturity.

## Notes

---

> - Companies will often not provide a breakdown of their trading securities because they're trying to earn short-term profits. They've got some kind of strategy or some kind of information advantage, and they're afraid that providing the detailed breakdown of where they have their investments and securities might give away where their information advantage is. So in the name of keeping their investment secrets, secret, they showed just one lite item for trading securities.

> - The idea of this held-to-maturity method, was that some companies argued hey, if I'm going to have a five year bond and I intend to hold it for five years and just collect the interest and principal, who cares whether the value goes up or down in the mean time? So FASB said fine, you can do that under that method, but they threw in this kicker that you have to disclose fair values of all your financial instruments, your marketable securities. So even though it doesn't show up on the balance sheet, we can at least go to the footnote and see what the fair value of these securities are. So it's not really hidden from us, we can just dig into the footnote and find the answer if we want to know what that fair value is.

> - When we look at these categories like foreign debt securities or equity securities, obviously it's lumping together a lot of investments. So within equity securities, you could have investments in a large number of companies, and even within the same company, you could have investments that were bought in the a long time ago versus more currently, and then each of these different investments are going to have embedded gains and embedded losses. Now we want to keep track of those embedded gains or embedded losses separately, so that when we sell the securities, we know whether that individual security we've got a gain or a loss. So we aggregate all of these together but in a more detailed level that we don't see here, we do keep track of individual unrealized gains and losses on all of our different investments.

> - A company actually could change their method or their classifications for individual securities to try to help their income. Now one thing that might help us, is the auditors would be there to ask questions. So, a company could probably get away with this once. Say our intention has changed, change the classification, get some extra income. But if they kept changing classifications every quarter, every year, the auditors would get suspicious and it would be hard to do this behavior. So maybe you can do it once, but not much more than that.
