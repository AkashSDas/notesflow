## Introduction

A long lived assets is an asset that provides benefits for more than a year. They are categorized into **tangible** (Property, plant, equipment i.e. physical) and **intangible** (goodwill, brand names, patents, customer lists i.e. not physical) assets.

## Capitalizing vs Expensing

Its important to understand the difference between capitalizing and expensing as they will come often while discussing about long lived assets.

So can be seen from the above example that capitalizing versus expensing doesn't change the total expense you recognize, it still has to equal the original cost, instead it changes the timing of when that expense hits your income statement.

So which method to use? The best approach is to choose capitalization, or expensing to communicate what's going on in your business. So, if some cost is going to benefit future revenue, then we should probably capitalize and amortize it. If it's not clear that the cost is going to benefit future revenue, then we should be expensing it immediately.

This is something you want to be aware of because the number two source of accounting frauds after revenue recognition **frauds** is this problem of expense recognition. Where companies will capitalize when they should've expensed, or expensed when the should've capitalized, because they want to shift the timing of earnings, one way, or another. So, this is definitely something to be cognizant of, and to question whether managers are doing this appropriately.

## Acquisition Costs for Long Lived Assets

---

> - Capitalize all costs necessary to get an asset ready for its intended use (e.g. purchase price, delivery price, installation cost, etc...)
> - For self constructed assets, also capitalize interest on debt that is incurred to finance the asset's construction.
>   - In this case, interest expense on the income statement does not reflect all of the interest costs incurred by the firm.
> - If acquisition costs include multiple classes of assets (e.g. land, building, machinery, etc...) the cost must be allocated into separate asset classes.

**How would capitalized interest affect EBITDA?** When people calculate EBITDA they subtract interest expense on the income statement. This capitalized interest won't show up, as part of interest expense on the income statement, and won't get added back. But, the capitalized interest goes into the balance of the long term asset account, which then gets depreciated. So, the way the capitalized interest will actually hit the income statement is just part of depreciation, which will then get added back as part of EBITDA. So, it turns out that, even though we capitalize interest, it won't show up in the EBIDTA measure, it'll get added back through depreciation, so you're okay in this situation by having a capitalized interest. You're not going to miss it, if you want to remove interest from your measure performance as you do in EBIDTA.

> **Note**: Creating an asset account is similar to work in process account just the difference is in one case we create something to keep and in other we create something to sell it (the latter one).

## Depreciation and Amortization

---

> **Terminologies**
>
> - Tangible assets (building and equipment) are depreciated
> - Intangible assets (patents, software) are amortized

> **Elements of depreciation calculation**
>
> - Depreciation basis = acquistion cost - salvage value
> - Useful life (years or units (like for producing 100million units))
> - Depreciation pattern (straight-line or acceleratedk)
>
> **All these elements are chosen by management**

### Depreciation Methods

---

> - **Straight line** (most common in financial statements)
> - Depreciation expense = (Acquisition cost - salvage value) / useful life

> - **Accelerated** (almost never used in financial statements)
> - Double declining balance: `Depreciation exp = (Cost - Acm. Depr.) * (2 / useful life)`
> - Sum of the years digits: `Depreciation exp = (Cost - Salvage) * (Remaining life / Sum of the years digit)`
> - MACRS(required in U.S. tax returns): `Call your tax accountant for details...`

> **Firms can use different methods for taxes and financial statement**

**Why would a company choose different methods for tax, and financial reporting purposes? Why is the tax method required, whilst the financial statement method can be anything?** you've gotta keep it in mind that the goals of tax reporting, and finance reporting are quite different. For tax reporting, the government's goal is to raise cash revenue. Now given that people always try to cheat on taxes, the government wants to be as explicit as possible in setting depreciation rules, so people don't have this wiggle room to try, and cheat on their taxes, or try to manage their taxes downward if we want to be a little bit more kind. But, for financial reporting, we want managers to communicate how the companies doing, are you getting enough revenue to cover all the costs of doing business? And by giving managers the ability to choose the depreciation method, to choose the salvage value, and the useful life to reflect how they in to use the asset, we get better information. We get information about how managers are going to use up their long-lived assets that we wouldn't get if we were following a one size fits all tax reporting approach. So, don't be, to be scared off by these two methods of reporting. One, tax reporting, is to generate tax revenue, it's very explicit. Financial reporting, the goal is to provide users information, and the best way that we can often do that is to provide flexibility, and discretion.

A key point to remember is that regardless of the method used for depreciation, total depreciation expense has to be the same over the life of the asset.

## Depreciation (Product or Period cost)

---

> - Remember depreciation could either be a product cost, or a period cost. A product cost where, if the depreciation is used in the manufacturing process, it goes directly into inventory, and won't show up on the income statement until the inventory is sold, and then it'll be part of costs of goods sold. So, costs of goods sold will include part of the depreciation. Period costs would be it's part of selling general, and administrator expenses, so providing the employees this perk, this form of compensation. In that case it is expensed as it's incurred, so we have depreciation expense go on the income statement right away. So, keep in mind that depreciation can either go into inventory, and cost a good sole, or it can go directly on to SGNA.

## Ongoing Costs for Long Lived Assets

---

> - Expense costs when they are related to the maintenance of an asset
> - Capitalize costs when they:
>   - Increases the life of the asset or
>   - Increases the values of the asset
> - These capitalized costs will add to future depreciation expense
>   - Also, adjust useful life and salvage value assumptions if necessary
>   - Recompute depreciation expense going forward
>   - Use Net Book value as new historical cost of asset

> **Wouldn't routine maintenance increase the life and the value of the asset?** There actually are no hard and fast rules for applying capitalizing versus expensing in this case. Instead we give managers the discretion to apply these guidelines that if a cost increases a life, or increases the value, then it can be capitalized. And I think the best way to illustrate what we mean by this is with a couple of examples.
>
> - So first let's say I buy a new car. Part of the value of that car assumes that I'm going to do routine maintenance. It assumes that I'm going to change change the oil when needed. That I'm going to rotate the tires. And so those routine maintenance costs should be expensed. So certainly the life of the car would be less if I didn't do that, but it's assumed that when you buy the car, that you're going to do that kind of routine maintenance. Now think of a different kind of cost that it could have with the car. Let's say I put a flame red decal on the side, I put a little spoiler on the back, maybe a T top. So if you're a fan of the old Smokey and. Smokey and the Bandit movies. You'll know what I'm talking about. But anyway, that kind of customization of the car, is going to increase its life, I'm going to be more willing to use it longer. Increase its value, people would pay more for it, so that will, those kinds of costs could be capitalized.
>
> - Another example. Let's say I have a building made out of wood. Wood needs to be painted every now and then to maintain the building. So the cost of painting a wood building would be routine maintenance and expense. Now let's say I have a brick building. You don't need to paint brick to keep it up. It'll last other last anyway. So if I paint a brick building, presumably I'm doing that to extend its life. I'll keep it longer, or increase its value. And so the cost of painting would be capitalized for a brick building, but expensed as maintenance for a wood building.
>
> That sort of seems like a trivial decision That sort of seems like a trivial decision, but actually one of the **big frauds** earlier in the century was all around this issue. WorldCom was basically taking routine maintenance, which should be expensed, and capitalizing it, which helped its EBITDA. Because what it was doing, it's turning an expense into depreciation. And of course, depreciation does not effect your EBITDA. So this is not a neutral decision. And there have been situations where companies have abused this to make themselves look much better.

**Companies are not only allowed to change depreciation assumptions at any time**, it's actually good practice for managers to change their assumptions if something big has changed with how they plan to use the asset. Remember we're counting on managers to communicate how long their going to use this asset to generate revenue. If something changes in that estimate, either because they've done some kind of additional expenditure to increase the life of the asset, or something has happened, so the asset's not going to last as long then, it's good practice for them to communicate that through new depreciation assumptions. Now, of course, it would be fishy if they were just changing assumptions to try to meet an earnings target, to try to make their earnings look better. So part of our job as users of financial statements is to first try to identify these changes in depreciation assumptions when they happen. And then see if we can find any other information about what the company is doing to see if they're justified. We don't go back and restate prior financials because our assumption is whatever managers' best estimate was in the past that's what we use for those financials. Now their best estimate has changed and so we'll just change the financials going forward.

## Disposal of PPE

---

> - Historical cost of asset is removed from PP&E account and all related depreciation is removed from `Accumulated Depreciation`.
> - Gain or loss on the sale of PPE is recorded when the proceeds from disposal are more or less than the net book value, respectively.
>   - Net book value = Historical cost - Accumulated depreciation

```text
Dr. Cash (+A)                             (sale amount)
Dr. Accumulated Depreciation (-XA)        (full balance)
Dr. Loss on sale (+E)                     (plug if Net Book Value > Cash)
    Cr. Gain on sale (+R)                      (plug if Net Book Value < Cash)
    Cr. Specific PP&E Account (-A)             (historical cost)
```

**Note**: You could have either gain or loss (and not both).

**Why would a company ever get a gain, or suffer a loss, on selling its equipment? Wouldn't it be the case that the company would sell it for exactly what it is worth?** Now the company is probably selling the piece of equipment for its market value, but keep in mind that the gain or loss is not relative to the market value. The asset hits relative to the book value of the asset. The book value of the asset is a function of how much we've depreciated it to this point, which is a function of those depreciation assumptions, the useful life and the salvage value that we made when we bought the piece of equipment. So if we depreciate too much, we bring down the value too far, we'll end up having a gain when we sell it. If we depreciate it too little, we don't depreciate it enough, we'll end up having a loss when we sell it. So think of this gain or loss as a last ditch correction, to get us to the point where the total expense over the life of the piece of equipment is the difference between what we originally paid for and what we ultimately sold it for at it its market value.

## Impairment Test

---

Long Lived assets must be written down if they fail an impairment test.

> - Step1: Have circumstances changed that raise the possibility of an impairment?
> - Step2: Are the future undiscounted net cash flows from the asset (from use or sale) less than its net book value?
> - Step3: Write-down the book value of the asset (and record a loss) equal to the difference between the fair value of the asset and its net book value
>   - **Note**: Discounted cash flows are used to compute fair value in Step3

## Internation differences for Long Lived Assets

---

> **Carrying value**
>
> - US GAAP requires the lower of cost or market with depreciation expense recorded each period
> - IFRS allows lower of cost or market method or fair value method. Under fair value method, PP&E is carried at fair value all the time, with any unrealized gains or losses either following through the income statement or directly to stockholder's equity.

> **Impairments**
>
> - US GAAP: Assets written down connot be written back up in value in later date
> - IFRS: Under lower of cost or market, assets written down can be written back up to the original cost of the asset (less accumulated depreciation). Also determination of whether an impairment is necessary is initially based on the discounted present value of cash flows.

## Intangible Assets

---

> In general US GAAP and IFRS require
>
> - Internally developed intangibles to be expensed immediately (R&D, Advertising, Employee Training, etc...)
> - Some types of R&D can be capitalized
>   - US GAAP: Software
>   - IFRS: Development
>   - Under US GAAP, Software Development R&D can be capitalized. After the point that the software project reaches technological feasibility, and under IFRS, any kind of development expense could be capitalized. So when you're trying to come up with a new product your doing research, that gets expensed immediately. Once the project reaches this technological feasibility point, then the cost after that when you're developing it could be capitalized and then amortized over time.
> - Purchased intangibles to capitalized as an asset (Purchased patent, trademark, customer lists, Goodwill, etc...)

### Purchased Intangibles

---

> **Purchased intangibles are usually added in an acquistion**
>
> - Intangible assets and liabilities must be separately recognized if:
>   - The intangible arises from a transferable contract or
>   - The intangible is separable
> - Non-separable intangibles are included in Goodwill

The 1st point of the 1st in the above list means that, if you get to clearly identify an intangible asset that you're getting. And, you can put a value on it, it should be a separate asset. So, for instance, if in part of the acquisition what you get the acquired company is their list of customers. And then, you can use that list of customers to now sell the product of your combined company. That's a separable intangible, and we can probably put a value on having that list of customers. Or maybe the company you acquired had a contract to run a restaurant in an airport. Gave them exclusive rights. When you acquire them, you get that contract, and so we value that contract as an intangible asset. It's the right to operate those restaurants. So basically anything that you acquire that you could separately identify as yes, this intangible asset represents this right or this, benefit that we go from the other company. We create a separate asset or liability for it.

### Goodwills

---

When an acquirer purchases target firm, the target's individual assets and liabilities are first adjusted to reflect their current market values. Then the acquirer records any separable or transferable intangible assets. Finally, **Goodwill equals the excess of the purchase price over the market value of net identifiable assets**.

So if you had two firms, firm A and firm B, are trying to acquire firm C. They get into a bidding war. Firm A wins the bidding war. They probably have suffered the winner's curse. Which says, if you win a bidding war, you're probably cursed by overpaying to acquire the company. Well, we have to account for that **difference between purchase price, and the fair value of all the net assets**, somewhere. And so, if we overpay, that over payment goes into the Goodwill asset, making it Goodwill in the sense of a good will towards your fellow company you acquire in that you were willing to overpay for it

So there are two issues here. The first the good will is a plug, so if you estimate those fair values of the net assets incorrectly, it directly affects your good will asset. So if you overestimate the fair value of the customer list, you will under state goodwill, or if you under state the fair value of that customer list, you'll over state goodwill. The second issue is, if you do anything to over state the value of the goodwill asset, including over paying an acquisition, you're susceptible to a goodwill impairment. So just like we talked about with long lived assets, where if the value of the long lived asset, the market value of the long lived asset drops below what it, is carried on the books, you have to write it down, if the market value of the goodwill, drops below its book value, then you have to write it down. Now its really hard to figure out the market value of goodwill. Basically, you try to do a valuation of all the business segments, add it up to get the value of the company. And, see if it's dropped below the book value, which would mean the Goodwill's been impaired.

So, good example of this, was back in the height of the internet bubble AOL, America Online, acquired Time Warner. Then in 2002, they had to take what was at the time the biggest loss in U.S. history by taking a goodwill impairment of $44.9 billion, basically writing down their goodwill asset by $44.9 billion. What happened is the synergies that AOL expected between their internet business, and the magazine and media business of Time Warner,. Never materialize, the company hadn't performed well, it was clear they overpaid, and so they take had to take that goodwill impairment charge, write down that goodwill asset.

## Good Questions

---

**Why is land included in the list of assets that have accumulated depreciation?** Land is not depreciated. For some reason, the historical tradition is to present property plant equipment in this manner, including land, which is not depreciated, with buildings, machinery equipment, which is depreciated. Just keep in mind that none of that accumulated depreciation applies to the land. The land comes on at historical costs and stays there unless there has to be some write down due to impairment.

**Why are the useful lives such big ranges? I mean, how useful is it to know that buildings are depreciated over 3 to 50 years?** This part of the disclosure generally is somewhat deficient in that it gives you too big a range to figure out exactly what kind of useful lives the company's doing, and Lyons company is especially egregious in combining assets that have three to fifty year lives. If I was an analyst or a big investor, I would complain about this disclosure, and ask the company to be a little bit more specific.

**So, the net book value of the PP&E that was sold was 9 million. Why did we sell it at a loss? Is that bad news?** No, it's not bad news, and this is a good review of something we talked about a couple videos ago, A gain or loss on sale does not mean that we sold it for less or more than its market value. We probably sold it for it's market value. The gain or loss represents the fact that we didn't depreciate it enough or we depreciated it too much. So in this case the loss means that we hadn't depreciated the asset enough by the time we sold it. So its book value is above its market value, and so the loss just corrects the fact that we hadn't appreciated it enough, but we did sell it for its market value.

In the case of a **patent**, it's reasonable to assume the salvage value is zero. Because once the patent expires, than any competitor can use that technology in their own product, and the peck technology advantage is gone. So, for the case of patent, and, and a lot of intangibles, you could assume safely zero salvage value. Now notice we did not do this kind of calculation for plant and equipment, because in that case there probably is salvage value, and we if try to do this kind of analysis there'd be a lot more error. So you can do it for intangible assets, but it's harder to do for tangible assets like property, plant and equipment.

> - We go to their balance sheet, we can see that total assets dropped from 2011 to 2012, driven by that big drop in Goodwill from the write-off. And so what this means is any ratios you look at that include earnings, assets, or equity will be adversely affected by the Goodwill write-off which is almost all of them, right? ROE, ROA, asset turnover, all of those ratios are going to be biased this year, by that Goodwill write-off, and to get a better comparison about how the company actually performs, you may want to add back that Goodwill write-off, before you calculate the ratios to get a better picture. But other than it keep a better picture of how the company performed this year.
> - We don't want to totally ignore the Goodwill impairment charts because it does suggest that the company made a bad acquisition, and that has potential implication for future cash flows,. And that we might not expect the company to perform as well, given that their acquisition didn't turn out as well as expected.
> - **Goodwill impairment charge has no impact on Cash Flow or EBITDA**
