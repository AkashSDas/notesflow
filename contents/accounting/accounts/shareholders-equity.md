## Introduction

---

Shareholder's equity is the residual claim on assets after settling claims of creditors (i.e. assets - liabilities). Shareholder's equity came from 2 places, one being issuance and other being operations.

> **Shareholder's equity due to issuance**
>
> - Contributed capital
>   - Common stock
>   - Preferred stock
> - Treasury Stock
>   - Repurchased shares that may be reissued

> **Shareholder's equity due to operations**
>
> - Retained Earnings: (End Retained Earnings = Beg Retained Earning + Net Income - Dividends)
> - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This functions sort of like retained earnings, except for it's items that bypass the income statement.

**The terms stockholder's equity, shareholder's equity, owner's equity just plain equity all mean the same thing.**

## Types of Stocks

---

> **Preferred Stock**
>
> - Between debt holders and common stock holders in claim on assets. So, what that means is if there was a bankruptcy, the company had to liquidate all its assets to give to it's creditors and owners. The debt holders would get first claim on the assets, whatever's leftover. Then the preferred stock holders would come in and then the common stockholders would come in last.
> - No voting rights, but pay a fixed dividends that must be paid before common dividends
> - May be callable, convertible or redeemable

> **Common Stock**
>
> - Voting rights, but residual claimant to assets
> - Common stock has all the voting rights, so they get to vote on who the board of directors will be, but they're the last claimant on assets so they have the biggest risk of loss and bankruptcy. But then they often get the biggest return if the company does well.

> **Par Value** - Stated value on shared used to compute balance in Common Stock or Preferred Stock

> **Additional Paid in Capital (APIC)** - Amount received in excess of par value

> - One of the reasons that investors like preferred stock is that some investors really like dividends. And with preferred stock, you get a guaranteed dividend, or at least guaranteed in that they can't pay common dividends until they pay all the preferred dividends. And in some countries, like the U.S, dividend income is taxed at a lower rate than interest income, like if you bought a bond.
> - Also, preferred stock is like a way to get your feet wet, or dip your toe in the water with a company where because of these call features and redeemable features, you can go into get preferred stock, you take a little bit more risk than a bond, but you have the option, often times, to convert that to common stock if you think the company is doing well. And if you don't think the company's doing well, then you can basically redeem it and get out of the company fairly easily. So it's a way to sort of get into the company's equity without diving in full, taking the full risks of common stock.

## Contributed Capital Terminologies

---

> **Share Authorized** - Total number of shares the firm could issue. This is often determined in the corporate charter, or by the board of directors, and it doesn't mean a lot. It just means that the management could go out and issue new shares up to this limit, and then they'd have to go and try to get permission to issue more shares.

> **Share Issued**
>
> - Number of shares that have been sold to the public
> - Balance in Common Stock at Par based on this amount
> - So if you took par value times the number of shares issued it should equal to balance in common stock par

> **Shares Outstanding**
>
> - Number of shares currently held by the public
> - Shares issued minus `treasury shares`
> - Dividends and Earnings per share based on this amount
> - How can that be different than shares issued? Well, it's because companies buy back their stocks in these treasury shares.

The **cumulative dividend** is basically a promise by the company that if they're going to pay any dividends at all, preferred stockholders are definitely going to get their $1 per year. So where this would come into play is let's say a company got into a cash crunch. They couldn't pay dividends so they skip preferred dividends for a year. They owe those preferred dividend shareholders at least $1 per share. Now let's say they couldn't pay the next year. Now they owe those preferred dividend, preferred stockholders $2 of dividends. Before the company could pay any common stock dividends, they have to go back and pay the two dollars of cumulative dividends that they've missed. So what happens is, if a company misses preferred dividends, they add up, they accumulate, and before the company can pay any common dividends, they have to pay all those accumulated dividends on the preferred stock.

## Share Repurchases and Treasury Stock

---

Compaines sometimes repurchase their own shares. Repurchased shares are carried in the Treasury Stock (XSE) account. So, XSE stands for contra shareholders equity. That means it goes up with a debit and down with a credit balance. So just the opposite of the way stockholders' equity normal works.

Treasury stock does not have any voting rights or dividends rights. Which makes sense, we wouldn't want the company voting on its own board of directors. Treasury Stock can be reissued by the firm at any point. Reissued means sold back to the public. The reissued treasury stock will come out of the treasury stock account at its original price. So it you repurchased at $11.00, when we take it out, we're going to bring it out at $11.00, and then APIC or in some cases Retained Earnings is used to balance the journal entry if we resell it for a price that differs from what we bought it. So if we bought it at $11, but then resell it at $13, we need to do something with that extra two dollars. It's going to go into APIC or Retained Earnings because **companies cannot book gains or losses trading in their own stock**.

> **There are four big reasons why a company would repurchase its own shares**
>
> - The first one is they may have excess cash. And instead of paying that cash out at a, as a dividend, which can have some problems that we'll talk about later, they decide to just buy back their shares. Basically give the excess cash to any shareholders that want to get out of their investment or cash out.
> - Second reason is the company may think their stock price is undervalued, and while you could talk to analysts or investors, or go on TV and talk about how your stock is under priced, a way to put your money where your mouth is, a costly signal, would be to go back and buy your shares because you think they're under priced.
> - The third reason, and this is one of the big reasons nowadays, is you buy back shares to sell to employees under employee stock option plans, and we'll talk about that later in the week.
> - And the fourth reason is you may think that you're under leveraged as a company, so you borrow some money, use the proceeds to buy back stock to increase your leverage, increase your debt to equity ratio, which would then increase your ROE.

**Why would the company not be enabled to record a gain in this transaction? They bought low, sold high, and should get credit for a gain** So, there's a couple of reasons why we don't allow companies to book gains or losses on transactions in their own stock in the income statement. First is the stock transactions have nothing to do with operating the company, so what we want on the income statement is revenues and expenses that apply to running the business. Buying and selling your stock doesn't have anything to do with your business. It's not your core operations, and the second reason is that this these stock transactions are easily manipulable by companies so it would be very easy for a company to book a gain trading in its own stock. All the company would have to do is come out with some pessimistic news, some bad forecast, the stock price would go down. The company buys it. Then a month or two later, come out with some good news, a good forecast, stock price goes up. They sell it. If we let them book a gain on that, that's not very high quality earnings because managers have a lot of control over the timing of that gain. So we don't want to have that kind of potential abuse, so any kind of stock transactions where companies have superior information, we keep off of the income statement.

**If APIC had a zero balance additional paid in capital can't go negative**. So if, if APIC had gotten down to zero, then you'd have to switch the debit to retained earnings instead, which is not a problem because retained earnings can have either a debit or a credit balance.

**How could a company ever have a balance of zero in APIC? And what if retained earnings was zero?** Actually, it's becoming more and more commonplace that companies' APIC is going down to zero, and they're having to go to a debit to retained earnings in this kind of journal entry, and again it's because of these employee's stock options. anytime an employee exercises a stock option and we use treasury stock to, to deliver the stock to them, they're playing less cash than what we bought the treasury stock for. And so we get this debit to APIC and so there's companies which have gone through all their APIC. APIC can't go negative so it stops at a zero balance and then we start to debit retained earnings, and for a lot of companies that do a lot of stock options, their return earnings actually go negative, as it can and becomes accumulated deficit. And in this case, the accumulated deficit is not bad news. It's not that their operations have been cumulatively unprofitable. It's actually good news. It means that their stock price has been going up. They've been giving a lot of options. The options have been exercised, and it's just eating into this APIC and retained earnings. So it's a weird feature of this stock based compensation that we're seeing nowadays. But you actually see a lot of these debits to APIC and then debits to retained earnings, and oftentimes negative retained earnings due to these employee stock options.

> **Treasury Stock Retirement**
>
> Now, retirement means that we're going to destroy the shares. We're, we're going to permanently retire them so that they can never be reissued and they'll be taken out of shares issued count. So these shares are gone for good.
>
> The stock retirement transaction is not that common. Most of the time when companies buy back their own treasury stock, they intend to either reissue it, or they hold on to it so they have the option to reissue it, sell it back to the market, at some point. The only time I've actually seen this retirement transaction practiced is when there's some kind of hostile battle between management and shareholders. Or where management's trying to take over the company. And so they're buying back shares to try to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands or increase their own ownership, and they basically destroy the shares to make it more costly to have them reissued later, but other than these really hostile battles, I haven't seen that many instances where companies retire their stock.

## Retained Earnings

---

It is the cumulative income that has not been paid out as dividends.

> - Net Income - Positive net income increases retained earnings, negative net income decreases retained earnings
> - Dividends - Decrease retained earnings since this is a return of equity to shareholders

## Cash Dividends

---

> **Declaration Date**
>
> - Company declares a dividend will be paid to all investors who hold shares as of the **date of record**. (e.g. 10days after the declaration date)

> **Date of Record**
>
> - Date on which investors must hold shares to be entitled to receive the dividends
> - An investor that sells shares after the record date is still entitled to receive the dividend

> **Payment Date**
>
> - Date on which the firm pays the dividend

> - **NOTE** - Firms are not required to pay dividends. However, once a firm has declared a dividend, the firm is legally obligated to pay it to its shareholders as of the record date. This creates a liability called **Dividend Payable**.

> **Ex-Dividend date**
> It takes about three days after a stock transaction happens before it gets recorded in the company's ledger. So that means that, any stock transactions that happen within two days of the date of record don't show up in time to be in the records to get the dividend. So three trading days before the date of record is the ex-dividend date. If you buy the stock after the ex-dividend date, you won't get the dividend. And so as a result, the stock price will go down after the ex-dividend date to reflect the fact that you're buying a stock. But you're not going to get paid the dividend that the other shareholders will get because those shareholders will be in the books on the date of record, whereas you bought it too late to show up in the date of record.

**Why are the dividends based on the number of shares outstanding, and not the number of shares issued?** So shares outstanding are the shares held by the public. Where shares issued, remember is shares outstanding plus the shares held in treasury owned by the company. It doesn't make sense for the company to pay itself dividends as an owner. So we ignore the treasury shares and we just pay the dividends to shares outstanding.

Let's say a company pays $0.05 dividend per share then **how does a company come up with a number like $0.50?** the $0.50 per share that the company's come up with. This is thought about very carefully, because there's this very important facet of dividends. It's really bad news if you ever cut a dividend. And we call this feature sticky dividends. So once you commit to a level of dividends, you really have to maintain that level. You could raise it in the future, but if you ever reduce the level of dividends your stock price will plummet. You'll get fired as a manager, because everyone will interpret it as bad news.

## Stock Dividends and Splits

---

### Stock Dividends

---

> - Each common stockholder is given a dividend in the form of new common shares
> - Each stockholder's percentage ownership of the company will be identical to what it was before the stock dividend
> - No cash flow involved
>   - If divided less than 25%: reduce Retained Earnings and increase common stock and APIC using current market price of the shares
>   - If dividend greater than 25%: reduce Retained Earnings and increase common stock using the par value of the shares

### Stock Splits

---

> - Each common share is replaced with a given number of new common shares.
> - No balance sheet, income statement or cash flow effect
>   - Adjust number of shares authorized, issued and outstanding as well as the par value

**Why would a company pay a stock dividend instead of a cash dividend? And why do a stock split if nothing really changes?** One reason to do a stock dividend might be that you don't have the cash to pay dividends, so you give stock instead. Although that would be viewed as bad news if you were doing that. Because it would mean that you're, you're constrained on cash flow. I think a more common reason that you see stock dividends, and especially stock splits, is there's this investor psychology finding out there about something called the natural trading range. And there's been research that found, that's found that investors don't like to trade in stocks where the stock price is too low, you know, say below $20 a share, or too high like in the hundreds, above a $100 a share. So what happens is the company is growing, it's stock price is going up. The managers see that their stock price is going to go outside of this trading range. They're afraid that they're going to lose some investors as a result. So a stock dividend, or specialty stock split will reduce the company's stock price back in to this natural range And it turns out that this kind of stock split or stock dividend would be interpreted as good news. Because it's managers saying, hey, we think our stock price is going to continue to go up substantially. And so to get it back in this range that you're comfortable with, we're going to split the stock and basically divide the stock price by two. Now there's obviously exceptions out there, like Berkshire Hathaway has a stock price which is in the tens of thousands. But the fact that I knew that off the top of my head indicates that they are the exception rather than the rule. If you look, most stocks have prices below $100. And part of it is that when the stock price starts getting too high, managers will do these stock dividends or stock splits to try to bring it down into this more comfortable range for investors.

**Why not issue stock for cash and then use that cash to save, pay dividends?**. The problem with issuing new stock to the market is that you dilute the ownership of current shareholders. Unless current shareholders can buy the new shares of stock issued their ownership percentage will go down. And some investors would be really unhappy if their ownership percentage went down in this way. So by doing a stock dividend you're keeping everybody's ownership percentage the same because everyone's getting the same percent of the dividend. So if a company really wanted to raise cash to pay cash dividend, they wouldn't issue stock because of this dilution problem, instead they would probably just borrow money and then use the borrowed money to pay dividends.

## Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

---

> - Debits (`expenses`, `losses`) and credits (`revenues`, `gains`) that `bypass` the income statement and go directly into shareholder's equity. This is for all those debits and credits that bypass the income statement so they can go directly into shareholders equity. So instead of having an expense or a loss run through the income statement into retained earnings, we have this debit to AOCI to bypass the income statement. Similarly, instead of a revenue or a gain going on the income statement and then to retained earnings. We just do a credit to AOCI to get it to stockholder's equity without going through the income statement.
> - **Rationale**: Compaines do not like volatile earnings caused by the market movements. Some accounting methods require marking assets/liabilities to fair values. Unrealized gains and losses would cause volatility in Net Income.
> - **Compromise**: GAAP and IFRS require companies to market-to-market, but allows unrealized gains/losses to bypass the income statement. But balance sheet must balance, so unrealized gains/losses go into Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, instead of through Net Income into Retained Earnings.
> - Items go into AOCI on an after-tax basis. Tax effect of an item goes into a Deferred Tax account.

**Companies don't like volatile net income. Bu presumably it is volatile for a reason. There are big movements in market values. It sounds like managers are a bunch of crybabies.** In some cases managers are crybabies. Because if they had to put these things on income statement, they could just put it in a separate line item. And do a voluntary disclosure where they gave you the net income with and without this, you know, volatility. But managers are so afraid that investors are going to overreact to this number on the income statement, they want to keep it off. And they try to make the argument that these are long term activities. And so if they're long term activities, it doesn't matter if there's quarter to quarter changes in market values. So that shouldn't have to show up on the income statement. Again I don't agree with that. But then companies also have the ability to make large donations to congressman and senators. And those congressman and senators can try to convince the FASB or internationally convince the ISB to make these compromises to protect their income against this volatility.

## AOCI Items

---

So as of now there are four items that go into AOCI. Now of course the standard setters may put more things into here in the future.

> - **Unrealized Gains/Losses on Marketable Securities** - Under Available for Sale treatment, unrealized gains and losses from making Marketable Securities to fair value are recorded in AOCI
> - **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments** - Converting the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidaries from the foreign currency to the domestic currency under the `Current Method` leads to unrealized gains and losses that go to AOCI
> - **Pension** - The difference between the actual gains/losses on pension assets and the excepted gains/losses on those assets goes to AOCI
> - **Derivatives** - For `Cash Flow Hedges`, unrealized gains and losses from marking Derivatives to fair value are recorded in AOCI

## Statement of Shareholder's Equity

---

> - Report the changes in all of the Shareholder's equity accounts. Present begining and ending balances in each account and show all increases and decreases during the year.
> - Common stock, APIC, Treasury Stock - Issuance and repurchases of stock, stock based compensation
> - Retained Earnings - Net Income, Dividends and some effects of stock based compensation
> - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income - All the items that effect AOCI
> - Noncontrolling Interest - For consolidated subsidaries will less than 100% ownership by company, noncontrolling interest shows the claims on net assets by outside owners in the subsidaries.

## Stock-based Compensation

So giving managers restricted stock or stock options as a form of compensation. Now this co, topic gets very complicated very quickly.

> **Restricted Stock Price**
>
> - Companies pay employees with shares of stock as compensation
> - Top executives that get almost all the options. There are some companies that have given options deeper into the organization to middle managers or even to hourly type employees, but for the most part the idea is that top management is the one making the decisions that's going to have the most impact on stock price. So to make sure that they make decisions that are aligned with shareholders interest, in other words make decisions to try to make stock price go up, we tend to load top management with the stock options.

> **Stock Option Plans**
>
> - Companies grant employees the right to purchase a number of shares at a fixed price (called the `exercise` or `strike` price) over a specified period of time (often 10years) as compensation.
> - Most of the time, the exercise price is set equal to the stock price at the time the options are granted (called an `at-the-money` option)

**How is giving employees the right to buy stock a form of compensation? It is like, here is your paycheck, now you owe me money.** So these stock options are only compensation if the stock price goes up, if they don't go up, then they're, they're worthless. But if the stock price goes up then what the manager can do is buy the stock at the exercise price, which is going to be lower than the current price, then they resell it at the current price and make a profit. The different between the current price and this lower, exercise price. In some companies they've even cut out the stock transaction. They've gone to cashless options where they just give managers the difference between the current price and the exercise price when they want to exercise, but in any case, this is compensation. But it's compensation that only kicks in if the stock price goes up, but that's why we give this compensation, because we want the managers to do things to make the stock price go up.

> - Generally some vesting period (normally 1-3 years) must pass before the employee is allowed to sell the stock or exercise the option
> - The value of the restricted stock or options granted is treated as an expense and recognized over the vesting period

**How can a stock option be an expense? The company is never giving the employee cash. There is no payable.** So both the FASB and the IASB view stock options as a form of compensation, and just like we expense cash compensation, we should expense stock option compensation as a cost of generating revenue. So even though there is no direct cash outlay for the stock compensation, it's still something to give to, we give to employees to get them to work for us to generate revenue and so it should be cost of doing business and there needs to be an expense. Now, companies fought this for over 20 years. The Standards Centers first proposed making this expense in the mid 80s and it wasn't until the mid 2000s until this finally went through. In fact there was a big controversy in the mid 90s where companies would heavily donate money to politicians. There was a famous US Senator that actually introduced a bill which said that the, and I'm paraphrasing, that the senate would outlaw the FASB if the FASB went ahead with this rule to require stock options to be an expense, and as a result the FASB caved in and it was another 10 years before stock options were made an expense.

**Restricted Stock Grant**
**Restricted Stock Vesting**
**Stock Option Grant**
**Stock Option Exercise**

**Deferred expense? Contra shareholders equity?** The standard's editors had to do a little bit of a finesse here because the company is issuing new shares, but they're going to the employee and the employee can't do anything with them yet. The employee is not a full owner. They can't sell these shares like a regular stockholder. And so you've got this vesting period that we have to wait before the shares fully belong to the employee. Plus there's the question of matching the expense to the revenue it generates. So if the idea that the employee has to work for two years in order to get the stock then that cost of the stock should be spread over the two years over that two year vesting period. So this contra shareholders' equity deferred compensation expense stores up this expense until we can spread it out over the two years that the employee works for us thereby matching the expense to the revenue this person is presumably generating.

**What would happen if a stock price goes up over the two years? Shouldn't there be more compensation expense in that case?** So in this case we ignore any movements in stock price after the grant date. So the idea is that the compensation we're giving the employee is the value of the stock on the grant date. After that it's just the employees good luck or bad luck if the stock price happens to go up or down. It doesn't change the value of what we initially granted the employee on the grant date. So we don't take account any changes in stock price in the company's expense. Any movements in stock price are good news or bad news for the employee but irrelevant for the expensing of the restricted stock by the company.

**What is the fair value of an option grant? And why is it less than the stock price?** Actually this fair value is not an unfair value. But it represents what an investor would pay for this option on the open market. So it is meant to be the correct or fair value of this option. Now the reason why the fair value is less than the current stock price is that the option only has value if the stock price goes up from $20. If the stock price stays at $20 or goes down the option is worthless. So part of what the fair value is estimating is the probability that the stock price will go above 20. If it goes above 20, then the stock option will be worth whatever the difference is between the current price and this $20, and if goes below 20, the stock option is worthless. The fair value estimate tries to take all that into account, and there's a lot of sophisticated techniques that we're not going to talk about to do this. The Black–Scholes model, the lattice binomial method. But for now just trust me that this fair value is indeed a fair value.

**Why is there a credit to APIC? Why not just toss this credit into accumulated other comprehensive income?** It would not be appropriate to put this in AOCI because it is already running through the income statement. There is a compensation expense on the income statement. Remember AOCI is for things that we normally would put on the income statement but we don't want to so instead we put it in AOCI. So the question is why put it in APIC? I don't know where else to put it. It doesn't really fit in any other kind of account. It's sort of like we're issuing stock but not quite because we really haven't done it yet. So I think what happens is we just put in APIC because we need the balance sheet to balance and we're doing weird things with APIC anyway so why not go ahead and credit APIC in this transaction?

when an employee exercises a stock option they're able to buy the stock at 20, sell it at 30, they make a profit of $10 per share. That profit of $10 per share is considered taxable income. So it goes on the employee's tax return and they pay taxes based on it. Now the IRS in the US has this philosophy of reciprocal taxation. So what's taxable income for one party of the transaction is a tax deduction for the other party. So the firm, the company, gets a tax deduction equal to $10 a share. That tax deduction will help them save taxes and those tax savings, that cash that they get in tax savings, is considered a cash from financing. Now this can get more complicated very quickly because if these tax deductions due to option exercises are big enough they can actually call, cause the company to have a net operating loss for tax purposes. Which then would put us into the whole, valuation allowance, deferred tax asset, NOL carryforward stuff.

## Earnings Per Share

---

### Earnings Per Share: Basics

---

EPS provides a measure of how much earnings was generated for each share of common stock held by outsiders.

> - Reported by the company at earnings announcement
> - Forecasted by security analysts
> - Compared to price per share to get **Price-Earnings** (P/E) ratio.

```text
Basics EPS = Net Income - Preferred Dividends
            ---------------------------------------
                Weighted average number of common
                shares outstanding
```

**Weighted average** means that we weigh the average by how long the shares were outstanding. So if we had 10,000 shares outstanding for three quarters of a year, 15,000 shares for one quarter of the year, we would take three fourths of 10,000 plus one fourth of 15,000 to get the weighted average. And we subtract preferred dividends because we're looking at this notion of how much is left for common share holders, so net income already takes out interest expense which are the distributions to bond holders. In addition, we take out the preferred dividends, which don't show up in the income statement, to get this notion of what is leftover for the common stock holders.

You really want to compare this to other per-share numbers for the company, like prior years' earnings per share, dividends per share, or maybe the most common use is price per share to get this price earnings multiple. So don't think of earnings per share as there's an absolute benchmark. But usually you're trying to meet last year's earning per share or analyst forecast for earnings per share. And then you're really concerned about this ratio of price per share to earnings per share. Hopefully it's high and high within your industry.

### Earnings Per Share: Diluted

---

Companies with `complex` capital structure also report Diluted EPS. Complex capital structures include securities that can be converted into stock at the investor's discretion eg. convertible debt, stock options and warrants. Some of the value of these convertible securities is tied to the value of common stock, thus, investors holding these securities are `indirect` stackholders.

Diluted EPS provides EPS assuming everything that could convert to a share of stock actually did so.

```text
Diluted EPS = Net Income - Preferred Dividends + Adj. for convertibles
              -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Wtd avg num of common shares outstanding + Adj. for convertibles
```

### Diluted EPS - Convertible Debt

---

> - Convertible debt can be exchanged for common stock
> - Diluted EPS is computed under the assumption that the convertible debt has been exchanged for common stock at the start of the period. This is called the **if converted** method.
> - Numerator of EPS: Net Income is increased by the after tax interest expense on the convertible bond. If debt had converted there would have been no Interest Expense, so it is added back to Net Income
> - Denominator of EPS: Number of shares is increased as if the debt was converted to common shares at the beginning of the period

### Diluted EPS - Stock Options

---

> - **In-the-Money** stock options give the holder the right to acquire a share of common stock at a pre-specified price. (In-the-money stock option would be one where the current stock price is above the exercise price. Which means you would have incentive to exercise it because you'd make a profit. And so those are the options that we're going to take into account for diluted EPS because those are the ones that can turn into stock at any point in time.)

> - Diluted EPS is computed under the assumption that a fraction of the options had converted to common shares. This is called the **treasury stock** method.

> - Numerator of EPS: No adjustment necessary

> - Denomination of EPS: Number of shares is increased by a fraction of each outstanding option
> - Number of additional stocks = Number of options x Conversion fraction
> - Conversion fraction = (Avg Stock Price - Exercise Price) / Avg Stock Price

**Conversion fraction** is not that descriptive, but it's sort of a shortcut way to figure out how to do this method. So the intuition is that the numerator, the average stock price minus the exercise price is the profit that you would get from exercising the option. So if the price was $40 and the exercise price was $10, you could make a profit of $30 per option you exercised. Now the assumption is you would take that $30 and go buy shares of stock at the current stock price. So how many shares could you buy for one option? Well, you get $30 profit divided by the $40 stock price you could buy three fourths of the share for one option. So we take that three fourths times the number of options it would be the number of shares that you could buy if you exercised.

**Diluted EPS keeps getting smaller the more items we add. Can it ever get bigger?** No. Diluted EPS can never get bigger than basic EPS. It's always going to be smaller, or equal to.

### Diluted EPS - Complications

---

Diluted EPS must always be less than or equal to Basic EPS

> - Diluted EPS is set equal to Basic EPS in years when a firm has a loss from continuing operations to common stockholders
> - If Diluted EPS would be greater than Basic EPS after a convertible is added to the calculation, the convertible is considered to be **antidilutive** and is excluded from computation of Diluted EPS
> - Options are considered **antidilutive** when exercise price is greater than the market price (i.e. when the option is **out of the money**). So, that makes sense because if the exercise price is greater than the market price nobody would ever exercise it you would be, you would buy the stock cheaper at the market price. You would never exercise the option.

So because of these features, you will always see that diluted EPS is either equal to basic, or it's less than basic EPS.

**Who cares?** Well shareholders certainly care, as do potential investors, because when you own a company and you're trying to use this earnings per share measure to figure out how much of these earnings are attributable to my shares of stock, one thing you worry about is that there can all of a sudden be new shares of stock out there, and if these new shares of stock appear due to convertible debt or stock options, how would that cut into the piece of the earnings that goes to you? So diluted EPS gives you that worse case scenario assuming everything that could convert converts. And see, let's you see how much your earnings would be eroded by these additional claims. This diluted EPS number then becomes the big number that people use when assessing performance, when comparing two price for the PE multiple, when comparing the dividends for share. So it is one of the big performance measures out there and that's why there's a requirement that it's reported.

**What about the proceeds from exercises of stock options? How do you know that some of the new shares were not for stock option exercises?** That's a good point. The proceeds from exercise of stock options could be cash received from issuing the new shares at least part of them. For this have a look in the footnote.

> - So when we're looking at the **fair value**, we're looking at an expectation based on a lot of parameters, of how much profit you can get. And that's only going to be if the stock price goes up. So it's not a number that you can compare directly to the stock price. Because it's the profit and the movement of stock price, rather than the value of the stock as it is with the share of stock.

> - Yet another noncash expense to add back on the SCF. How do you expect us to keep track of all of these? But we put a lot of noncash expenses into net income. And if we're going to go from net income, the cash flow under the indirect method, we gotta add them back or subtract them out.
> - The good news I guess is that if you're just going to be a user of financial statements rather than a preparer, you don't have to memorize them. You can just look at the statement of cash flows. And you'll see all these noncash expenses or revenues added back or subtracted out on the face of the statement. I just need you to be aware, aware of why they're there. And recognize that these are noncash items which is why they're adjusted, not cash items.

> - So, is this the real economic cost of stock options? A company buys back stock at $62 and sells it to employees for only $43? They are losing almost $20 per option! >> Yeah, but we talked about stock compensation earlier. We had mentioned that it seems to be a form of compensation where there's no cash outflow. And certainly if PupCo had just issued new shares, there would have been no cash outflow at all. But, of course, that dilutes the ownership of current shareholders. Current shareholders don't like that. And so companies often tend to use treasury stock to satisfy these employee stock option purchases. If you're going to purchase the stock as you sell to the employees, you will always take a loss as we see here. Because you're basically buying at the current price and selling it to the employees at the lower exercise price. So companies often try to manage this by buying the treasury stock earlier. Or they'll buy stock options in their own stock so that they could buy it at a lower price. But, but yeah, if you just compare the, the price of the treasury stock to the price that you're getting on the stock options, that is a quick and dirty measure of the true cash cost of this option compensation for the company.
> - Six lousy cents! It makes no sense to have to do a complex diluted EPS calculation to find a lousy six cent difference. >> Come on Dave. Give me break. How many times you been walking down the street, seeing a penny laying on the sidewalk, and picked it up, and happily put that one cent in your pocket? So $0.06 can matter. Especially if you own say 1% of PupCo's outstanding shares. That's 10 million shares of stock. 10 million times $0.06 is $600,000. That would be a lot of net income that's going into the pockets of these convertible debt or stock option holders instead of your own pocket. So this stuff can add up pretty quickly and so $0.06 in this case can really matter.
