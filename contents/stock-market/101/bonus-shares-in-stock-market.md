## Introduction

---

Bonus shares is, `x free share for every n share held`, where n is decided by the company. Here the `face value of the company remains same`. Bonus shares are additional shares given to the current shareholders without any additional cost, based upon the number of shares that a shareholder owns. Companies issue bonus shares to encourage retail participation and increase their equity base.

`Before bonus = cum bonus` (but value of investment remains same). `Post bonus = ex bonus` (but value of investment remains same).

**Bonus Ratio**: `m:n => you get m shares for every n shares held`. Example: 1:2, here you'll get 1 share for every 2 shares held.

So if you have 1 share of worth $100 and the company declares bonus shares at the ratio of 1:1 then you'll have 2 shares with a combined worth of $100. Here the face value remains same, so the number of shares changes (increases). So now since the price of individual share has decreased then more people will buy it causing a rise in demand which in turn will increase the price of individual share. This is a great benefit of bonus shares.

> - **NOTE** - When bonus shares are alloated then price of each share decreses, this might lead to false assumption that something is bad as the price has fallen, so always have a look at this.

> **Key Dates**

> - **Announcement Date**: The date at which company announces that they are going to give bonus shares.

> - **Ex-Bonus Date**: The stocks bought date after this date will be excluded from the benefits of bonus stocks and also the price of the stocks will have decreased on this date due to increase in number of stocks. So to enjoy the benefits of bonus stocks buy the stocks before the ex-bonus(excluding bonus) date. Since the price of each share on this date will be decrease due to bonus shares, people can buy shares at lower price and will except to get bonus shares which will not happen, so to avoid this date you should buy shares before ex-bonus date.

> - **Record Date**: On this date you should have stocks which were bought on the day prior to ex-bonus date in your demat account to get bonus shares on just the shares bought on the day prior to ex-bonus date.

## When will you pay tax for bonus shares?

---

If you received bonus shares on a x date then x + 365day will be considered a year for the new shares you got and if you sell them after x + 365days then it will be considered as Long term capital loss/gain. You can save tax here.

> - **NOTE: It's always good to have a look at the current taxes.**

## Difference between stock split and bonus shares

---

Both, stock split and bonus issue multiply the number of shares and bring down the market value however it is only stock split that has an impact on the face value. This is a key difference between bonus issue and stock split. Bonus issues indicates that the company has generated extra reserves that it can transfer to its share capital. Stock split is an initiative to make expensive shares available for a larger shareholder audience.

**Consider the example below to understand the difference**

| Details                   | -      | Stock split | Bonus shares |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| Stock price               | 50     | 25          | 25           |
| Face value                | 10     | 5           | 10           |
| No. of outstanding shares | 5000   | 10000       | 10000        |
| Market capitalization     | 250000 | 250000      | 250000       |
| Reserve profits           | 100000 | 100000      | 50000        |

> - In bonus shares new shares are generated and thats why they are bonus while in stock split existing stock's face value is split, so they are not bonus and their face value is splitted.

> - **Reserve Profits** is the profit that company has reserved over the years.
