## Introduction

---

Bonus shares is, `x free share for every n share held`, where n is decided by the company. Here the `face value of the company remains same`. Bonus shares are additional shares given to the current shareholders without any additional cost, based upon the number of shares that a shareholder owns. Companies issue bonus shares to encourage retail participation and increase their equity base.

`Before bonus = cum bonus` (but value of investment remains same). `Post bonus = ex bonus` (but value of investment remains same).

**Bonus Ratio**: `m:n => you get m shares for every n shares held`. Example: 1:2, here you'll get 1 share for every 2 shares held.

> **Key Dates**

> - **Announcement Date**: The date at which company announces that they give bonus shares

> - **Ex-Bonus Date**: The stocks bought date after this date will be excluded from the benefits of bonus stocks and also the price of the stocks will have decreased on this date due to increase in number of stocks. So to enjoy the benefits of bonus stocks buy the stocks before the ex-bonus(excluding bonus) date. Since the price of each share on this date will be decrease due to bonus shares, people can buy shares at lower price at will except to get bonus shares which will be not good. So to avoid this date you should buy shares before ex-bonus date.

> - **Record Date**: On this date you should have stocks which were bought on the day prior to ex-bonus date in your demat account to get bonus shares on just the shares bought on the day prior to ex-bonus date

If you received bonuse shares on a x date then from that x + 365day will be considered a year for the new shares you got and if you sell them after x + 365days then it will be considered as Long term capital loss/gain. You can save tax here

**NOTE: It's always good to have a look at the current taxes.**
