## Introduction

---

The term `shareholder` is used to denote any person, institution or company that has ownership of at least one share of a companyâ€™s stocks, also referred to as equity. Also known as `stockholders`, such entities are partial owners of a company and are entitled to a share in the profits that the said company generates. These profits are provided to stockholders by way of dividend distribution, or through an increase in stock valuation.

Similarly, when the share price of a company drops due to losses suffered by it in a given year, shareholders to suffer a loss from their investment. It consequently leads to a decline in their portfolio value.

In this regard, it is crucial to note that _when a company liquidates its assets, common stockholders receive their proceeds only after creditors, bondholders and preference stockholders have received their portion of the profit._ Furthermore, in case a company declares bankruptcy, stockholders also stand a chance of losing their entire investment.

> - If a company goes into `liquidation`, all of its assets are distributed to its creditors. Secured creditors are first in line. Next are unsecured creditors, including employees who are owed money. Stockholders are paid last.

## Types of Shareholders

---

Shareholders of a company are of two types â€“ common and preferred shareholder.

> `Common share or stockholders`:
> As their name suggests, they are the owners of a companyâ€™s common stocks. These individuals enjoy voting rights over matters concerning the company. Furthermore, they can also exercise the aforementioned rights, including filing class-action lawsuits against any matter that can harm the organisation.

> `Preferred share or stockholders`:
> Preferred stockholders, on the other hand, enjoy precedence over common stockholders when it comes to a companyâ€™s profit distribution. While they do not hold a right to vote in matters pertaining to a companyâ€™s executive decisions, preferred stockholders are entitled to fixed dividend rates, even if said companyâ€™s profitability is at stake.

## Shareholder vs. Subscriber

---

Before a company becomes public, it starts out first as a private limited company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of people called `subscribers`. The subscribers are considered the first members of the company whose names are listed in the memorandum of association. Once the company goes public, their names continue to be written in the public register and they remain as such even after their departure from the company.

## Shareholder vs. Stakeholder

---

Shareholder and Stakeholder are often used interchangeably, with many people thinking that they are one and the same. However, the two terms donâ€™t mean the same thing. A shareholder is an owner of a company as determined by the number of shares they own. _A stakeholder does not own part of the company but does have some interest in the performance of a company just like the shareholders._ However, their interest may or may not involve money.

For example, a chain of hotels in the US that employs 3,000 people has several stakeholders, including its employees because they rely on the company for their job. Other stakeholders include the local and national governments because of the taxes the company must pay annually.
