## Introduction

---

An order is a `set of instructions` to a broker to buy or sell an asset on a trader's behalf. There are multiple order types which will affect what price the investor buys or sells at, when they will buy or sell, or if their order will be filled or not. Which order type to use depends on the trader's outlook for the asset, whether they want to get in and out quickly, and/or how concerned they are about the price they get.

Orders are used to buy and sell stocks, currencies, futures, commodities, options, bonds, and other assets.

> **Notes**
>
> - The last traded price is not necessarily the price at which the market order will be executed.
> - In fast-moving and volatile markets, the price at which you actually execute (or fill) the trade can deviate from the last traded price.
> - The price will remain the same only when the bid/ask price is exactly at the last traded price.

## Process

---

Investors utilize a broker to buy or sell an asset using an order type of their choosing. Once an investor has decided to buy or sell an asset, they initiate an order. The order provides the broker with instructions on how to proceed.

Generally, exchanges trade securities through a `bid/ask process`. This means that to sell there must be a buyer willing to pay the selling price. To buy there must be a seller willing to sell as the buyer's price. Unless a buyer and seller come together at the same price, no transaction occurs.

The `bid` is the highest advertised price someone is will to pay for an asset, and the `ask` is the lowest advertised price someone is willing to sell an asset at. The bid and ask are constantly changing, as each bid and offer represents an order. As orders are filled, the levels will change. For example, if there is a bid at 25.25 and another at 25.26, when all the orders at 25.26 have been filled, the next highest bid is 25.25.

This bid/ask process is important to keep in mind when placing an order, as the type of order selected will impact the price the trade is filled at, when it will be filled, or whether it will be filled at all.

## Order Types

---

> - **Market Order**: A market order instructs the brokerage to complete the order at the next available price. Market orders have no specific price and are generally always executed unless there is no trading liquidity. Market orders are typically used if the trader wants in or out of a trade quickly and is not concerned about the price they get.

### Limit Order

---

> - **Limit Buy Order**: A limit buy order instructs the brokerage to buy a security at or below a specified price. Limit orders ensure that a buyer pays only a specific price to purchase a security. Limit orders can remain in effect until they are executed, expire, or are canceled.

> - **Limit Sell Order**: A limit sell order instructs the broker to sell the asset at a price which is above the current price. For long positions, this order type is used to take profits when the price has moved higher after buying.

### Stop Order

---

> - **Sell Stop Order**: A sell stop order instructs the brokerage to sell if an asset reaches a specified price below the current price. A stop order can be a market order meaning it takes any price once triggered, or it can be a stop limit order where it can only execute within a certain price range (limit) after being triggered.

> - **Buy Stop Order**: A buy stop order instructs the broker to buy an asset when it reaches a specified price above the current price.

### Others

---

> - **Day Order**: A day order must be executed during the same trading day that the order is placed.

> - **Good Till Canceled (GTC)**: GTC orders remain in effect until they are filled or canceled.

If an order is not a `day order` or a good `till canceled order`, the trader typically sets an expiry for the order.

> - **Immediate Or Cancel (IOC)**: IOC means that the order only remain active for a very short period of time, such as several seconds.

> - **All Or None (AON)**: An AON order specifies that the entire size of the order be filled, an partial fills will not be accepted.

> - **Fill Or Kill (FOK)**: A FOK order must be completed immediately and completely or not at all and combines an AON order with an IOC order.

> - **Take Profit**: A take profit order (sometimes called a `profit target`) is intended to close out the trade at a profit once it has reached a certain level. Execution of a take profit order closes the position. This type of order is always connected to an open position of a pending order.

### Stop Loss Order

---

A `stop-loss order` is also referred to as a `stopped market`, `on-stop buy`, or `on-stop sell`, this is one of the most useful orders. This order is different because, unlike the limit and market orders, which are active as soon as they are entered, this order remains dormant until a certain price is passed, at which time it is activated as a market order.

**Example**

For instance, if a stop-loss sell order were placed on the XYZ shares at $45 per share, the order would be inactive until the price reached or dropped below $45. The order would then be transformed into a market order, and the shares would be sold at the best available price. You should consider using this type of order if you don't have time to watch the market continually but need protection from a large downside move. A good time to use a stop order is before you leave on vacation.

## Difference between take profit and limit sell orders

Take profit orders `guarantee the full volume will be executed`, with the risk of possible market `price slippage`. They incur a taker fee. Limit orders `guarantee the limit price or better`, but cannot guarantee that all of your volume will be executed.

---

The `order types used can greatly affect the results of a trade`. When trying to buy, for example, placing a buy limit at a lower price than what the asset is trading at currently may give the trader a better price if the asset drops in value (compared to buying now). But putting it too low may mean the price never reaches the limit order, and the trader may miss out if the price moves higher.

One order type isn't better or worse than another. Each order type serves a purpose and will be the prudent choice in different situations.

> When buying a stock, a trader should consider how they will get in, and how they will get out at both a profit and loss. This means there are potentially three orders that can be placed at the outset of a trade:
>
> - one to get in,
> - a second to control risk if the price doesn't move as expected (referred to as a `stop loss`), and
> - another to eventually trade profit if the price does move in the expected direction (called a `profit target`).
>
> A trader or investor doesn't need to place their exit orders at the same time they enter a trade, but they still should be aware of how they will get out (whether with a profit or loss) and what order types they will use to do it.

**Example**

Assume a trader wants to buy a stock. Here is one possible configuration they could use for placing their orders to enter the trade as well as control risk and take profit.

They watch a `technical indicator` for a trade signal and then place a market order to buy the stock at $124.15. The order fills at $124.17. `The difference between the market order price and the fill price is called slippage`.

They decide that they don't want to risk more than 7% on the stock, so they place a sell stop order 7% below their entry at $115.48. This is the loss control, or stop loss.

Based on their analysis, they believe they can expect a 21% profit from the trade, which means they expect to make three times their risk. That's a favorable `risk/reward ratio`. Therefore, they place a sell limit order 21% above their entry price at $150.25. This is their profit target.

One of the sell orders will be reached first, closing out the trade.

## Market Order vs. Limit Order

---

In market you order buy/sell immediately at the current price or near to posted ask/bid.

Market orders are `popular among individual investors` who want to buy or sell a stock without delay. The advantage of using market orders is that you are `guaranteed to get the trade filled`; in fact, it will be executed as soon as possible. Although the investor doesn't know the exact price at which the stock will be bought or sold, market orders on stocks that trade over tens of thousands of shares per day will likely be executed close to the bid/ask prices

A limit order, sometimes referred to as a `pending order`, allows investors to `buy and sell securities at a certain price in the future`. This type of order is used to execute a trade if the price reaches the pre-defined level; the `order will not be filled if the price does not reach this level`. In effect, a limit order sets the maximum or minimum price at which you are willing to buy or sell. If's of 4 types: `Buy Limit`, `Sell Limit`, `Buy Stop`, `Sell Stop`.

## Market and Limit Order Costs

---

When deciding between a market or limit order, investors should `be aware of the added costs`. Typically, the commissions are cheaper for market orders than for limit orders. The difference in commission can be anywhere from a couple of dollars to more than $10. For example, a $10 commission on a market order can be boosted up to $15 when you place a limit restriction on it. When you place a limit order, make sure it's worthwhile.

## Summary

> - A **market order** simply buys (or sells) shares at the prevailing market prices until the order is filled.
> - A **limit order** specifies a certain price at which the order must be filled, although there is no guarantee that some or all of the order will trade if the limit is set too high or low.
> - **Stop orders**, a type of limit order, are triggered when a stock moves above or below a certain level; they are often used as a way to insure against larger losses or to lock in profits.
