## Speculation

---

> - Speculation refers to the act of conducting a financial transaction that has substantial risk of losing value but also holds the expectation of a significant gain.

In the world of finance, `speculation`, or `speculative trading`, refers to the act of conducting a financial transaction that has substantial risk of losing value but also holds the expectation of a significant gain or other major value. With speculation, the risk of loss is more than offset by the possibility of a substantial gain or other recompense.

Without the prospect of substantial gains, there would be little motivation to engage in speculation. **It may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between speculation and simple investment**, forcing the market player to consider whether speculation or investment depends on factors that measure the nature of the asset, expected duration of the holding period and/or amount of leverage applied to the exposure.

**Example**

For example, real estate can blur the line between investment and speculation when buying property with the intention of renting it out. While this would qualify as investing, buying multiple condominiums with minimal down payments for the purpose of reselling them quickly at a profit would undoubtedly be regarded as speculation.

`Mutual funds` and `hedge funds` often engage in speculation in the foreign exchange markets as well as bond and stock markets.

## Gambling vs. Speculation

---

Gamblers bet on a particular `outcome` that `is determined purely by chance`, such as a specific number at a roulette table. In stock trading, a gambler may buy a stock because he simply thinks, or “bets,” that it will go up based on nothing more than a gut feeling. A speculator seeks out situations with as many factors in his favor as possible.

## Investing vs. Speculation

---

Investing is buying and holding an asset for the long haul with the expectation that it will appreciate in value. Speculation is seeking immediate profits by frequently buying and selling.
