Dividend is paid on `face value`, where face value is the orignal price at which the share was bought by the promoters of a company. The face value of a company is decided by its promoters and `number of shares = money invested / face value`.

So if a company has a face value of $2 and wants to give 1000% dividend then you'll get $20 (1000% of the face value i.e. $2 ðŸ‘‰ $20).

## Difference between interest and dividends

`Interest` is paid on FD, debenture, interest may not vary after the investment but it will be announced and will be implemented on new investments, interest payment is mandatory, taxable.

`Dividends` is paid on Shares, it's not mandatory (even if the company if profitable they can decide that they don't want to give dividends eg. Apple, Google, many argue that the company do better investment with the profit then the investor), not tax free, subject to limits.
