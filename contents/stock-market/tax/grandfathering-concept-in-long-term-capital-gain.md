In **short term capital gain** you have to pay tax but for a long time tax on **LTCG** was 0% but later on the **LTCG** above certain amount started being taxed as per new law. This created stress among investors.

Consider the following example to understand the stress. So if I bought shares on 1993. From 1st April 2018 any LTCG occurs, then that will be taxed.

| -                       | amount |
| ----------------------- | ------ |
| Cost of acquisition     | 100    |
| Selling price 1/04/2018 | 2500   |
| Capital Gain            | 2400   |
| No. of shares           | 100    |
| Total capital gain      | 240000 |
| Taxable capital gain    | 140000 |
| Tax amount              | 14000  |

Now people we getting crazy that they have to pay so much tax. So if the person has sold these stocks at 31/03/18 then he/she has to pay Rs.0 tax but if he/she sold them at or after 1/04/2018 then he/she have to pay Rs.14000 as tax. So as a relief **Grandfathering** concept was introduced.

> - **Grandfathering provision** - The gain occuring as on 31 Jan 2018 have been grandfathered. This is done by introducing a deming provision in the law whereby **cost of acquisition** of the security would be considered to be higher of the **actual cost** or **fair market** value of the security on **31 Jan 2018**. However to avoid any arbitary loss situation, if the actual sale consideration is lower than the fair market value as on 31 Jan 2018, the cost of acquisition would be either the actual sale consideration or actual cost, whichever is higher.

| Different values                                    | Situation 1 | Situation 2 | Situation 3 | Situation 4 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Actual cost of acquisition (Purchase on 1 Jan 2017) | 100         | 100         | 100         | 100         |
| Fair market value on 31 Jan 2018                    | 200         | 50          | 200         | 200         |
| Acutal sale consideration (Sale on 1 Apr 2018)      | 250         | 150         | 50          | 150         |
| Deemed cost of acquisition                          | 200         | 100         | 100         | 150         |
| Taxable long term capital gain / (loss)             | 50          | 50          | -50         | Nil         |
