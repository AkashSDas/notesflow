## Introduction

Short selling and put options are fundamentally `bearish strategies` used to `speculate` on a potential decline in the underlying security or index. These strategies also help to `hedge` downside risk in a portfolio or specific stock. These two investing methods have features in common but also have differences that investors should understand.

Short selling involves the sale of a security not owned by the seller but borrowed and then sold in the market, to be bought back later, with potential for large losses if the market moves up. Buying a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the underlying asset at a price stated in the option, with the maximum loss being the premium paid for the option.

For an experienced investor or trader, choosing between a short sale and puts to implement a bearish strategy depends on many factors including investment knowledge, risk tolerance, cash availability, and if the trade is for speculation or hedging.

## Not Always Bearish

---

As noted earlier, short sales and puts are essentially bearish strategies. But, just as in mathematics the negative of a negative is a positive, short sales and puts can be used for bullish exposure as well.

For example, say you are bullish on the S&P 500. Instead of buying units of the S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), you initiate a short sale of an ETF with a bearish bias on the index, such as the inverse ProShares Short S&P 500 ETF (SH) that will move opposite to the index.

However, if you have a short position on the bearish ETF, if the S&P 500 gains 1%, your short position should gain 1% as well. Of course, specific risks are attached to short selling that would make a short position on a bearish ETF a less-than-optimal way to gain long exposure.

While puts are normally associated with price declines, you could establish a short position in a put—known as “writing” a put—if you are neutral to bullish on a stock. The most common reasons to write a put are to earn premium income and to acquire the stock at an effective price, lower than its current market price.

Here, let's assume XYZ stock trades at $35. You feel this price is overvalued but would be interested in acquiring it for a buck or two lower. One way to do so is to write $35 puts on the stock that expire in two months and receive $1.50 per share in premium for writing the put.

If in two months, the stock does not decline below $35, the put options expire worthlessly and the $1.50 premium represents your profit. Should the stock move below $35, it would be “assigned” to you—meaning you are obligated to buy it at $35, regardless of the current trading price for the stock. Here, your effective stock is $33.50 ($35 - $1.50). For the sake of simplicity, we have ignored trading commissions in this example that you would also pay on this strategy.

## Short Sale vs. Put Options Example

---

To illustrate the relative advantages and drawbacks of using short sales versus puts, let’s use Tesla Motors (TSLA) as an example.

Tesla has plenty of supporters who believe the company could become the world’s most profitable maker of battery-powered automobiles. But it also had no shortage of detractors who question whether the company’s market capitalization of over US$567.83 billion—as of Dec. 7, 2020—was justified.

Let’s assume for the sake of argument that the trader is bearish on Tesla and expects it to decline by March 2014. Here’s how the short selling versus put buying alternatives stack up:

> **Sell Short on TSLA**
>
> - Assume 100 shares sold short at $177.92
> - Margin required to be deposited (50% of total sale amount) = $8,896
> - Maximum theoretical profit—assuming TSLA falls to $0—is $177.92 x 100 = $17,792
> - Maximum theoretical loss = Unlimited
> - `Scenario 1`: Stock declines to $100 by March 2014 giving a potential $7,792 profit on the short position (177.92 – 100) x 100 = $7,792).
> - `Scenario 2`: Stock is unchanged at $177.92 by March 2014 the short expire worthlessly giving $0 profit or loss.
> - `Scenario 3`: C Stock rises to $225 by March 2014—giving a potential $4,708 loss on short position (177.92 – 225) x 100 = -$4,708).
>
> **Buy Put Options on TSLA**
>
> - Assume buying one put contract—representing 100 shares—at $29 with a strike at $175 expiring March 2014.
> - Margin required to be deposited = None
> - Cost of put contract = $29 x 100 = $2,900
> - Maximum theoretical profit—assuming TSLA falls to $0 is ($175 x 100) - $2,900 = $14,600)
> - Maximum possible loss is the cost of the put contract $2,900
> - `Scenario 1`: Stock declines to $100 by March 2014 giving a $4,600 potential profit on the put position (175 – 100 = 75) x 100 = $7,500 - $2,900 contract = $4,600
> - `Scenario 2`: Stock is unchanged at $177.92 by March 2014 giving a $2,900 loss of the contract price.
> - `Scenario 3`: Stock rises to $225 by March 2014 giving a $2,900 potential loss on the put position as the put would not be picked up by another trader.
>   With the short sale, the maximum possible profit of $17,792 would occur if the stock plummeted to zero. On the other hand, the maximum loss is potentially infinite. The trader could have a loss of $12,208 at a stock price of $300, $22,208 if the stock rises to $400, and $32,208 at a price of $500, and so on.

With the put option, the maximum possible profit is $14,600, while the maximum loss is restricted to the price paid for the puts.

Note that the above example does not consider the cost of borrowing the stock to short it, as well as the interest payable on the margin account, both of which can be significant expenses. With the put option, there is an up-front cost to purchase the puts, but no other ongoing expenses.

Also, the put options have a finite time to expiry. The short sale can be held open as long as possible, provided the trader can put up more margin if the stock appreciates, and assuming that the short position is not subject to buy-in because of the large short interest.

> - Short selling and using puts are separate and distinct ways to implement bearish strategies. Both have advantages and drawbacks and can be effectively used for hedging or speculation in various scenarios.

## Questions and Answers

---

> **Can You Short Sell Options?**: Short selling involves the sale of financial instruments, including options, based on the assumption that their price will decline.

> **Can I Short Sell Put Options?**: A put option allows the contract holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price by a specific time. This includes the ability to short-sell the put option as well.

> **What Is Long Put and Short Put With Examples?**:
>
> - A long put involves buying a put option when you expect the underlying asset's price to drop. This play is purely speculative. For instance, if Company A's stock trades at $55, but you believe the price will decline over the next month, you can make money from your speculation by buying a put option. This means you're going long on a put on Company A's stock, while the seller is said to be short on the put.
> - A short put, on the other hand, occurs when you write or sell a put option on an asset. Let's say you believe Company X's stock, which trades at $98, will drop in the next week to $90 and you decide to make the purchase. If the put option trades at $2, you sell it and net $200, setting at your buying price at $90, provided the stock trades at that price on or before the date of expiration.

> **What Is a Short Position in a Put Option?**: A short position in a put option is called writing a put. Traders who do so are generally neutral to bullish on a particular stock in order to earn premium income. They also do so to purchase a company's stock at a price lower than its current market price.
