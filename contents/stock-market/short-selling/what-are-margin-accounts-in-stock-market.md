## Introduction

A margin account is a `brokerage account` in which the broker lends the customer cash to purchase stocks or other financial products. The loan in the account is collateralized by the securities purchased and cash, and comes with a `periodic interest rate`. Because the customer is investing with borrowed money, the customer is using leverage which will magnify profits and losses for the customer.

## How a Margin Account Works

---

If an investor purchases securities with margin funds, and those securities appreciate in value beyond the interest rate charged on the funds, the investor will earn a better total return than if they had only purchased securities with their own cash. This is the advantage of using margin funds.

On the `downside`, the brokerage firm charges interest on the margin funds for as long as the loan is outstanding, increasing the investor’s cost of buying the securities. If the securities decline in value, the investor will be `underwater` and will have to pay interest to the broker on top of that.

If a margin account’s equity drops below the `maintenance margin` level, the brokerage firm will make a `margin call` to the investor. Within a specified number of days—typically within three days, although in some situation it may be less—the investor must deposit more cash or `sell some stock to offset` all or a portion of the difference between the security’s price and the maintenance margin.

A brokerage firm has the right to ask a customer to increase the amount of capital they have in a margin account, sell the investor’s securities if the broker feels their own funds are at risk, or sue the investor if they do not fulfill a margin call or if they are carrying a negative balance in their account.

The investor has the potential to lose more money than the funds deposited in the account. For these reasons, a margin account is `only suitable for a sophisticated investor` with a thorough understanding of the additional investment risks and requirements of trading with margin.

A margin account may not be used for buying stocks on margin in an `individual retirement account`, a trust or other fiduciary accounts. In addition, a margin account cannot be used with stock trading accounts of less than $2,000.

## Margin on Other Financial Products

---

Financial products, other than stocks, can be purchased on margin. `Futures` traders also frequently use margin, for example.

With other financial products, the `initial margin` and maintenance margin will vary. Exchanges or other regulatory bodies set the minimum margin requirements, although certain brokers may increase these margin requirements. That means margin may vary by broker. The initial margin required on futures in typically much lower than for stocks. While stock investors must put up 50% of the value of a trade, futures traders may only be required to put up 10% or less.

Margin accounts are required for most `options` trading strategies as well.
