## What Are Financial Risk Ratios and How Are They Used to Measure Risk?

---

Financial risk ratios `assess` a `company's capital structure` and `current risk level` in relation to the `company's debt level`. These ratios are used by investors when they are considering investing in a company. Whether a firm can manage its outstanding debt is critical to the company's financial soundness and operating ability. `Debt levels` and `debt management` also significantly impact a company's profitability, since funds required to service debt reduce the net profit margin and cannot be invested in growth.

Some of the financial ratios that are most commonly used by investors and analysts to assess a company's financial risk level and overall financial health include the debt-to-capital ratio, the debt-to-equity ratio, the interest coverage ratio, and the degree of combined leverage.

## Debt to Capital Ratio

---

The `debt-to-capital ratio` is a measure of `leverage` that provides a basic picture of a company's financial structure in terms of how it is capitalizing its operations. The debt-to-capital ratio is an indicator of a firm's financial soundness. This ratio is simply a comparison of a company's total short-term debt and long-term debt obligations with its total capital provided by both shareholders' equity and debt financing. Lower debt-to-capital ratios are preferred as they indicate a higher proportion of equity financing to debt financing.

## Debt to Equity Ratio

---

The `debt-to-equity ratio (D/E)` is a key financial ratio that provides a more `direct comparison of debt financing to equity financing`. This ratio is also an indicator of a company's ability to meet outstanding debt obligations. Again, a lower ratio value is preferred as this indicates the company is financing operations through its own resources rather than taking on debt. Companies with stronger equity positions are typically better equipped to weather temporary downturns in revenue or unexpected needs for additional capital investment. Higher D/E ratios may negatively impact a company's ability to secure additional financing when needed.

## Interest Coverage Ratio

---

The `interest coverage ratio` is a basic measure of a `company's ability to handle its short-term financing costs`. The ratio value reveals the number of times that a company can make the required annual interest payments on its outstanding debt with its current earnings before taxes and interest. A relatively lower coverage ratio indicates a greater debt service burden on the company and a correspondingly higher risk of default or financial insolvency.

A lower ratio value means a lesser amount of earnings available to make financing payments, and it also means the company is less able to handle any increase in interest rates. Generally, an interest coverage ratio of 1.5 or lower is considered indicative of potential financial problems related to debt service. However, an excessively high ratio can indicate the company is failing to take advantage of its available financial leverage.

> - Investors consider that a company with an interest coverage ratio of 1.5 or lower is likely to face potential financial problems related to debt service.

## Degree of Combined Leverage

---

The **degree of combined leverage provides a more complete assessment of a company's total risk by factoring in both operating leverage and financial leverage**. This leverage ratio estimates the combined effect of both business risk and financial risk on the company's `earnings per share (EPS)` given a particular increase or decrease in sales. Calculating this ratio can help management identify the best possible levels and combination of financial and operational leverage for the firm.
