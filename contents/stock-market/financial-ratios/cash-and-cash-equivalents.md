Cash and cash equivalents refers to the `line item` on the balance sheet that reports the value of a company's assets that are cash or can be converted into cash immediately. Cash equivalents include bank accounts and marketable securities, which are debt securities with maturities of less than 90 days.

However, `oftentimes cash equivalents do not include equity or stock holdings` because they can fluctuate in value.

Examples of cash equivalents include commercial paper, Treasury bills, and short-term government bonds with a maturity date of three months or less. Marketable securities and money market holdings are considered cash equivalents because they are liquid and not subject to material fluctuations in value.

If a company has cash or cash equivalents, the aggregate of these assets is always shown on the top line of the balance sheet. This is because `cash and cash equivalents are current assets`, meaning they're the most liquid of short-term assets.

Companies with a healthy amount of cash and cash equivalents can reflect positively in their ability to meet their short-term debt obligations.

> - **Types of Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Cash, Foreign Currency, Cash Equivalents (investments that can readily be converted into cash).

> - **What are not included in CCE ?**: There are some exceptions to short-term assets and current assets being classified as cash and cash equivalents.

> - **Credit Collateral**: Exceptions can exist for short-term debt instruments such as Treasury-bills if they're being used as collateral for an outstanding loan or line of credit. Restricted T-bills must be reported separately. In other words, there can be no restrictions on converting any of the securities listed as cash and cash equivalents.

> - **Inventory**: Inventory that a company has in stock is not considered a cash equivalent because it might not be readily converted to cash. Also, the value of inventory is not guaranteed, meaning there's no certainty in the amount that'll be received for liquidating the inventory.
