## Introduction

---

Ratios are the result we get after dividing a number by other number. eg. `result = x / y`. In accounting it what we divide by what is very important and it can help us to ask right questions in the right direction. `Rememeber ratios don't give answers, they just help us to ask right questions`.

## What are uses of Ratios?

---

Ratios are useful in assessing profitability, liquidity and risk. They highlight sources of competitive advantage and `red flag` potential trouble. Ratios must be compared to a benchmark, we must be able to compare same firm across time (time-series analysis) and we must also be able to compare firm to other firms or to industry (cross-sectional analysis).

Ratios are contextual, so try to determine the underlying activity that the ratio represents to determine whether it is good or bad news.

## Misusing ratios

---

Standard ratios have multiple definitions since there is no GAAP for ratio definiations, which we can use to make valid comparisons.

Choosing the appropriate benchmark for comparison is important. As major changes in the firm distort time-series analysis. Differences in business strategy, capital structure or business segements distort cross-sectional analysis. Also differences in accounting methods make all comparisons difficult.

Ratios may be manipulated by managerial action. So ratios can be misuesed in lot ways so its very important be careful.
