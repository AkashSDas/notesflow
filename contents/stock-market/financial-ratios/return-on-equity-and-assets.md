## Return on Equity

---

So is a net income of $10,000,000 good or bad? ... Answer is, it depends in level of investment required, here ROE will helps us to ask better questions.

> - Return of Equity (ROE) = `Net Income` / `Shareholder's Equity`

The numerator represents how much return the company generated for shareholders during the year based on accural accounting. The denominator represents the shareholder's investment in the company. Here **you must take the average of beginning and ending balance**.

ROE helps us to measure the `Return on Investemnt (ROI)`. This should increase with the risk of the company.

### Drivers of ROE

---

The two dirvers of ROE are `Operating performance` and `Financial leverage`.

> **Operating performance** tells how effectively do managers use company resources (assets) to generate profits? which in turn gives use `Return on Assets (ROA)`.
>
> - ROA = `Net Income` / `Average Assets`

> **Financial leverage** tells how much do the managers use debt to increase avaiable assets for a given level of shareholder investment.
>
> - Financial leverage = `Average Assets` / `Average Shareholder's Equity`

Note that `this is different from many leverage ratios` like you hear about eg. debt-to-equity, etc...

### ROE Framework

Example: Company raises $100 from shareholders and borrows $100 from bank to buy $200 of assets, which are used to generate $10 of net income

> - ROE = 10% (10/100)
> - ROA = 5% (10/200)
> - Leverage = 2 (200/100)
>
> - ROE = ROA x Leverage
> - 10% = 5% x 2

## Return on Assets

---

`Profitability` and `Efficiency` are the two drivers of Return on Assets.

> **Prfitability** is how much profit does the company earn on each dollor of sales? where `Return on Sales (ROS)` is used.
>
> - ROS = `Net Income` / `Sales`

> **Efficiency** is how much sales does the company generate based on its avaiable resources? where the `Asset Turnover` is useful.
>
> - ATO = `Sales` / `Average Assets`

### ROA and Leverage

---

Ideally ROA would measure operating performance independent of the company's financing decisions, but the numerator of ROA, Net Income includes Interest Expense.

> - More leverage `>` Higher interet expense `>` Lower net income

To truly remove all financing effects from ROA, we must de-lever Net Income

> - ROA = `De-Levered Net Income` / `Average Assets`
> - De-Levered Net Income = `Net Income` + `(1 - t)` x `Interest Expense`

> - ROE = (`Net Income` / `Sales`) x (`Sales` / `Assets`) x (`Assets` / `Equity`)
> - ROE = `Profitability` x `Efficiency` x `Leverage`
