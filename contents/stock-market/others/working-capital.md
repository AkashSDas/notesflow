## Introduction

---

Working capital, also known as `net working capital (NWC)`, is the difference between a company’s current assets, such as cash, accounts receivable (customers’ unpaid bills) and inventories of raw materials and finished goods, and its current liabilities, such as accounts payable. Net operating working capital is a measure of a company's liquidity and refers to the difference between operating current assets and operating current liabilities. In many cases these calculations are the same and are derived from company cash plus accounts receivable plus inventories, less accounts payable and less accrued expenses.

> - Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Working capital is a measure of a company's liquidity, operational efficiency and its short-term financial health. If a company has substantial positive working capital, then it should have the potential to invest and grow. If a company's current assets do not exceed its current liabilities, then it may have trouble growing or paying back creditors, or even go bankrupt.

> - High working capital isn't always a good thing. It might indicate that the business has too much inventory or is not investing its excess cash.
> - Positive working capital indicates that a company can fund its current operations and invest in future activities and growth.

## Changes in Working Capital Affect a Company's Cash Flow

---

Most major new projects, such as an expansion in production or into new markets, require an investment in working capital. That reduces cash flow. But cash will also fall if money is collected too slowly, or if sales volumes are decreasing – which will lead to a fall in accounts receivable. Companies that are using working capital inefficiently can boost cash flow by squeezing suppliers and customers.

## How do you calculate working capital?

---

Working capital is calculated by taking current assets and deducting current liabilities. For instance, if a company has current assets of $100,000 and current liabilities of $80,000, then their working capital would be $20,000. Common examples of current assets include cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. Examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, short-term debt payments, or the current portion of deferred revenues.
