## Introduction

If the promoters of the company require **working capital** for day to day work then one option is that they go to bank take money in term of loan, here the bank will ask something in terms of security ... So what securitites will the promoters give ... one of the security is their shares and this is **pledging of shares**.

So let's say you took a loan of $50, ofcourse the bank will want more than $50 worth of securities so let's say you gave $100 worth of shares to the bank as securities. Now if the market value of these shares falls let's they went from $100 to $80 then their will be a shortfall of $20 which the bank will demand recovery for.

> Promoter will have few options
>
> - They will have to pledge share of worth another $20
> - They have to pay $20 to the bank
> - They can repay the loan worth of $10 to balance the loan in terms of securities pledge

What if none of the above things happen then the bank, since they have ownership of these shares since the company has pleged these shares to the bank ... it is as good as the bank is the owner of those shares and if the promoter fails to pay this money then bank will sell off those shares in the market to recovery the money. This is bad for the company since their will be demand and supply imbalance since a huge sell comes into the market where the demand and supply is more or less the same, so now the stock price will fall.

So higher percentage of share pledge is not supposedly bad but it some what not good and if the fundamentals of the company are bad then that's a bad news.

## SEBI's role

> **SEBI has made few rules like**
>
> - The moment you have more and more percentage of shares pledged then you have to disclose it, so you can see this data on **NSE**, **BSE** and even in **moneycontroll.com**
>
> - If you are investor in a company where the company's more than 25% of the shares are pledged then you have to keep a higher margin with the broker when you are trading in such shares.
