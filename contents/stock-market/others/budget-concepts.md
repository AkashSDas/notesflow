## Fiscal Deficit

---

Consider the below example

> - Expenses - $150,000
> - Income - $100,000
> - The **Shortfall** of $50,000 here is called **Deficit**

So for goverment it is know as **Fiscal Deficit** where the word fiscal comes from the word `fisc` which means `Goverment Treasury`. Fiscal deficit is number that is expressed in percentage to `GDP` terms. For example, this year's fiscal deficit is 3%, 3% of what? ... of GDP. Can goverment say that this year's fiscal deficit is 80% of GDP ... No they can't because the goverment is bound to by the **Fiscal Responsibility Budget Management Act, 2003** to keep the fiscal deficit in check.

To cover this fiscal deficit, goverment can do two things, **Borrow** and **Print money**. Obviously goverment cannot print unlimited money because that will lead to **inflation**.

## Union Budget

---

In simple words it is a **statement of income and expenditure**.

### Understanding incomes of the goverment

---

> It can be a recurring income
>
> - Income tax
> - GST
> - Other taxes

> Once in a while incomes
>
> - Sell of spectrum
> - Sell of mining rights
> - Dinvestment in public sector undertaking

### Understand the exapenses of the goverment

---

> Recurring expenses
>
> - Salaries & Pensions of Goverment Employees
> - Giving Subsidies

> Once in a while expenditures
>
> - Building an airport

So in the union budget all the incomes and expenditures are listed down.

> Union budget will be divided into 3 parts
>
> - Incomes and Expenses of **last year**
> - Expected Incomes and Expenses of the **current year**
> - Economy analysis (here they will analyse pain points in the economy and will allocate money to those sectors)

## Lifeline of Budget a) Budget Formulation

---

The printing of the budget will happen roughly around 10 days prior to the day when the budget is presented. The preparation of budget starts 5-6 months before the budget is presented

> So if you talk about budget of financial year 2021 then the budget will be divided into another 3 parts
>
> - What happened previsous year - Acutal income and expense of 2019-2020
> - Whatever budget that was estimated in the previous year might have changed so - Revised estimated of 2020-2021
> - Budget estimates for the next year - Budget estimates of 2021-2022

Important thigh to note is that Finance minster will try to understand these contents of budget and then will approach the Prime minister and cabinet minsters to make sure everybody are on same page.

## Lifeline of Budget b) Budget Enactment

---

Once the finance minster has given speech then it has to be approved by the Legislature. Legislature is both the house of parliament - Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. So legislature has to approve two bills namely **Finance Bill** and **Appropriation Bill**.

> - Finance Bill - Includes financial proposals made by the goverment for the year.
> - Appropriation Bill - Permissions taken by the goverment to withdraw funds from the treasury.

One important thing to note is that the parliament can seek or request changes for the finance bill but not in the appropriation bill.

## Lifeline of Budget c) Budget Execution

---

Budget is implement from the 1st of April.
