## Introduction

Hedging is a `risk management strategy` employed to `offset losses` in investments by taking an opposite position in a related asset. Put another way, investors hedge one investment by making a trade in another.

The reduction in risk provided by hedging also typically results in a reduction in potential profits. Hedging strategies typically involve `derivatives`, such as `options` and `futures` contracts.

The best way to understand hedging is to think of it as a `form of insurance`. When people decide to hedge, they are insuring themselves against a negative event's impact on their finances. This doesn't prevent all negative events from happening. However, if a negative event does happen and you're properly hedged, the impact of the event is reduced.

In practice, hedging occurs almost everywhere. For example, if you buy homeowner's insurance, you are hedging yourself against fires, break-ins, or other unforeseen disasters.

Technically, to hedge requires you to make offsetting trades in securities with negative correlations. Of course, you still have to pay for this type of insurance in one form or another.

For instance, if you are long shares of XYZ corporation, you can buy a `put option` to protect your investment from large downside moves. However, to purchase an option you have to pay its premium.

## Understanding Hedging

---

Hedging techniques generally involve the use of financial instruments known as `derivatives`. The two most common derivatives are `options` and `futures`. With derivatives, you can develop trading strategies where a loss in one investment is offset by a gain in a derivative.

**Example:**

Suppose you own shares of Cory's Tequila Corporation (ticker: CTC). Although you believe in the company for the long-run, you are worried about some short-term losses in the tequila industry. To protect yourself from a fall in CTC, you can buy a put option on the company, which gives you the right to sell CTC at a specific price (also called the strike price). This strategy is known as a married put. If your stock price tumbles below the strike price, these losses will be offset by gains in the put option.

Another classic hedging example involves a company that depends on a certain commodity. Suppose that Cory's Tequila Corporation is worried about the volatility in the price of agave (the plant used to make tequila). The company would be in deep trouble if the price of agave were to skyrocket because this would severely impact their profits.

To protect against the uncertainty of agave prices, CTC can enter into a futures contract (or its less-regulated cousin, the forward contract). A futures contract is a type of hedging instrument that allows the company to buy the agave at a specific price at a set date in the future. Now, CTC can budget without worrying about the fluctuating price of agave.

If the agave skyrockets above the price specified by the futures contract, this hedging strategy will have paid off because CTC will save money by paying the lower price. However, if the price goes down, CTC is still obligated to pay the price in the contract. And, therefore, they would have been better off not hedging against this risk.

Because there are so many different types of options and futures contracts, an `investor can hedge against nearly anything`, including stocks, commodities, interest rates, or currencies.

## Why its good to know about hedging?

The `majority of investors will never trade a derivative contract`. In fact, most buy-and-hold investors ignore short-term fluctuations altogether. For these investors, there is little point in engaging in hedging because they let their investments grow with the overall market. So why learn about hedging?

Even if you never hedge for your own portfolio, you should understand how it works. Many big companies and investment funds will hedge in some form. For example, oil companies might hedge against the price of oil. An international mutual fund might hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Having a basic understanding of hedging can help you comprehend and analyze these investments.

## Example of a Forward Hedge

---

A classic example of hedging involves a wheat farmer and the wheat futures market. The farmer plants his seeds in the spring and sells his harvest in the fall. In the intervening months, the farmer is subject to the price risk that wheat will be lower in the fall than it is now. While the farmer wants to make as much money as possible from his harvest, he does not want to speculate on the price of wheat. So, when he plants his wheat, he can also sell a six-month futures contract at the current price of $40 a bushel. This is known as a forward hedge.

Suppose that six months pass and the farmer is ready to harvest and sell his wheat at the prevailing market price. The market price has indeed dropped to just $32 per bushel. He sells his wheat for that price. At the same time, he buys back his short futures contract for $32, which generates a net $8 profit. He therefore sells his wheat at $32 + $8 hedging profit = $40. He has essentially locked in the $40 price when he planted his crop.

Assume now that the price of wheat has instead risen to $44 per bushel. The farmer sells his wheat at that market price, and also repurchases his short futures for a $4 loss. His net proceeds are thus $44 - $4 = $40. The farmer has limited his losses, but also his gains.
