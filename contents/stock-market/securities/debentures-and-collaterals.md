## Collateral

---

The term **collateral refers to an asset that a lender accepts as security for a loan**. Collateral may take the form of real estate or other kinds of assets, depending on the purpose of the loan. The collateral acts as a form of protection for the lender. That is, if the borrower `defaults` on their loan payments, the lender can seize the collateral and sell it to recoup some or all of its losses.

## Debentures

---

**Debentures is a financial insturment through which the owner of a company can raise funds**. The person who gives money to the company is know as `debenture holder`, that person won't be an owner of the company but will be a lender to the company. The person get a fixed rate of interest of returns.

**Debenture interest is paid before paying out dividends**. You can buy/sell debentures from the broker or stock exchange. Majority of the companies that offers debentures are listed on the stock exchange. So you can easily buy/sell these debentures in the secondary market. To sell the your debentures you can sell them any time only in extreme conditions there won't be any buyer.

Always invest in `secured debentures` so that even if the company goes backrupt you can get your capital back (it may take a long time to get your capital back but it's guaranteed that you'll get your capital back). `Rating agencies`: if a company has got great ratings from various rating agencies then it's good. But the agencies can overnight change the ratings from A to D (happend in case of DHFL). `There are other parameters you should look other than ratings`.

There are other ways to increase the interest rates on debentures (like if you have any debenture/stock the you'll get an increment in the intereset rate). You can also use the montly payout from debentures and use it to invest `Micro Mutual Funds` in `SIP`, this will diversify your protfolio.
