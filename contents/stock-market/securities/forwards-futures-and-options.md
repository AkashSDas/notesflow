## Forwards

---

Unlike standard `futures` contracts, a forward contract can be customized to a commodity, amount, and delivery date. Commodities traded can be grains, precious metals, natural gas, oil, or even poultry. A forward contract settlement can occur on a cash or delivery basis.

Forward contracts do not trade on a centralized exchange and are therefore regarded as `over-the-counter (OTC)` instruments. While their OTC nature makes it easier to customize terms, the lack of a centralized clearinghouse also gives rise to a higher degree of default risk.

Because of their potential for default risk and lack of a centralized clearinghouse, `forward contracts are not as easily available to retail investors as futures contracts`.

## Futures

---

Futures are derivative financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset or the seller to sell an asset at a predetermined future date and set price. The buyer must purchase or the seller must sell the underlying asset at the set price, regardless of the current market price at the expiration date.

Underlying assets include physical commodities or other financial instruments. Futures contracts detail the quantity of the underlying asset and are standardized to facilitate trading on a futures exchange. Futures can be used for hedging or trade speculation.

A futures contract allows an investor to speculate on the direction of a security, commodity, or financial instrument.

> **Types of Futures**:
>
> - Commodity futures such as crude oil, natural gas, corn, and wheat
> - Stock index futures such as the S&P 500 Index
> - Currency futures including those for the euro and the British pound
> - Precious metal futures for gold and silver
> - U.S. Treasury futures for bonds and other products

Here `margin can be a double-edged sword`, meaning gains are amplified but so too are losses. Also investors have a risk that they can lose more than the initial margin amount since futures use leverage.

The futures markets typically use high leverage. Leverage means that the trader does not need to put up 100% of the contract's value amount when entering into a trade. Instead, the broker would require an initial margin amount, which consists of a fraction of the total contract value.

Whenever you buy future you don't buy them like 1 or 2 or 3, you buy them as a lot (n number of shares) where if that company's stock price is $100 then the using the leverage provided by future and your broker you can buy a lot in lower price where each share will cost 10%, 20%, 30% of the original price. Here the percentage is decided by the broker.

## Options

---

An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell - depending on the type of contract they hold - the underlying asset. Unlike futures, the holder is not required to buy or sell the asset if they choose not to. In simple terms => options are financial derivatives that give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price and date.

> **Types**
>
> - `Call options` allow the holder to buy the asset at a stated price within a specific timeframe.
> - `Put options` allow the holder to sell the asset at a stated price within a specific timeframe.

Call options and put options form the basis for a wide range of option strategies designed for hedging, income, or speculation.

Each option contract will have a specific expiration date by which the holder must exercise their option. The stated price on an option is known as the `Strike Price`. Although there are many opportunities to profit with options, investors should carefully weigh the risks.

Options are a versatile financial product. These contracts involve a buyer and a seller, where the buyer pays an options premium for the rights granted by the contract. Each call option has a bullish buyer and a bearish seller, while put options have a bearish buyer and a bullish seller.

Options contracts usually represent 100 shares of the underlying security, and the buyer will pay a premium fee for each contract. For example, if an option has a premium of 35 cents per contract, buying one option would cost $35 ($0.35 x 100 = $35). The premium is partially based on the strike priceâ€”the price for buying or selling the security until the expiration date. Another factor in the premium price is the expiration date. Just like with that carton of milk in the refrigerator, the expiration date indicates the day the option contract must be used. The underlying asset will determine the use-by date.
