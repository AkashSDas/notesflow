## Introduction

---

Market capitalization (also called market cap) refers to the `total market value` of a company's outstanding shares of stock. Market cap is the multiplication of total number of a company's outstanding shares by the current market price of one share.

> **Formula for calculating market cap**:
>
> - Market Cap = `Share price` X `number of outstanding shares`

**Example**

As an example, a company with 10 million shares selling for $100 each would have a market cap of $1 billion. The investment community uses this figure to determine a company's size, as opposed to using sales or total asset figures. In an acquisition, the market cap is used to determine whether a takeover candidate represents a good value or not to the acquirer.

## Importance of Market Capitalization

While investing, it is important to know what a company is worth and often difficult to quickly and accurately estimate. Market cap is a quick and easy method for estimating a company's value by extrapolating what the market thinks it is worth for publicly traded companies. Since Market cap shows the size of the company and by knowing the `size of the company` which is in correlation with various factors including `risk`

After a company goes public and starts trading on the exchange, its price is determined by supply and demand for its shares in the market. If there is a high demand for its shares due to favorable factors, the price would increase. If the company's future growth potential doesn't look good, sellers of the stock could drive down its price. The market cap then becomes a real-time estimate of the company's value.

## Market Cap and Investment Strategy

---

Given its simplicity and effectiveness for risk assessment, market cap can be a helpful metric in determining which stocks you are interested in, and how to diversify your portfolio with companies of different sizes.

> - **Large Cap (Big Cap)**: Large-cap, or big-cap, companies typically have a `market capitalization of $10 billion or more`. These large companies have usually been around for a long time, and they are major players in well-established industries. Investing in large-cap companies does not necessarily bring in huge returns in a short period of time, but over the long run, these companies generally reward investors with a consistent increase in share value and dividend payments.

> - **Mid Cap**: Mid-cap companies generally have a `market capitalization of between $2 billion and $10 billion`. Mid-cap companies are established companies that operate in an industry expected to experience rapid growth. Mid-cap companies are in the process of expanding. They carry inherently higher risk than large-cap companies because they are not as established, but they are attractive for their growth potential.

> - **Small Cap and Micro Cap**: Companies that have a `market capitalization of between $300 million to $2 billion` are generally classified as small-cap companies. These small companies could be young in age and/or they could serve niche markets and new industries. These companies are considered higher risk investments due to their age, the markets they serve, and their size. Smaller companies with fewer resources are more sensitive to economic slowdowns. As a result, small-cap share prices tend to be more volatile and less liquid than more mature and larger companies. At the same time, small companies often provide greater growth opportunities than large-caps.

> - Even smaller companies are known as **micro-cap**, with values between approximately `$50 million and $300 million`.

The numbers at which these market caps are divided keeps on changing. In order to make an investment decision, you may need to factor in the market cap of some investments.

## Changes in Market Cap

> **Two main factors can alter company's market cap:**
>
> - Significant changes in the price of a stock
> - when a company issues or repurchases shares.

An investor who exercises a large number of `warrants` can also increase the amount of shares on the market and negatively affect shareholders in a process known as `dilution`.
