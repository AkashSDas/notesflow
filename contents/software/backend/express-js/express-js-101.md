Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

Express is fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. Also Express can be used to build `server side` or `backend` system and if used to create `server side` system and then used some frontend framework like `React`, `Vue`, `Flutter`, etc... then that will be a powerful combination.
